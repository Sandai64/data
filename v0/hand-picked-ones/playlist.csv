'Alright' kicks things off, a huge anthemic soulful piano led disco stomper that will undoubtedly be a real highlight in your DJ set. This is some peak time feel good music for the dancefloor, London even gets a shout-out! 'Stars' is our B-side, and it's beamed right in from the cosmos into our eardrums, it has it all from cosmic synth melodies to ultra heavy drums and beyond! Get lost in space to this one, you won't regret it. Both cuts here definitely bring it, and as always - they sound amazing. File under 'must cop'. In true Kon fashion, these tracks have been respectfully remixed by Kon from source, and they won't stick around for long. Don't sleep!

The original Buena Vista Social Club album was recorded for World Circuit Records over six days at the vintage EGREM studios in Havana. Released in 1997, the album went on to become a worldwide phenomenon, selling over 8 million copies and contributing to the rise in popularity of Cuban, as well as Latin American, music.

Since forming in London in the mid-1980s, World Circuit Records has made its reputation by producing some of the finest albums of the past three decades. The label’s prestigious roster includes Buena Vista Social Club and associated solo artists (including Ibrahim Ferrer, Rubén González, Omara Portuondo and Orlando ‘Cachaíto’ López), Malian blues pioneer Ali Farka Touré, Malian divas and social activists Oumou Sangaré and Fatoumata Diawara, master kora player Toumani Diabaté, the illustrious Orchestra Baobab, musical iconoclast Cheikh Lô, and Fela Kuti’s legendary drummer and co-creator of Afrobeat Tony Allen. 
 
With reissues and brand new releases coming soon, World Circuit continues to bring diverse, genre-defying music to a wider audience.

LYRICS
(Spanish)
De Alto Cedro voy para Marcané
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí. 
El cariño que te tengo
Yo no lo puedo negar
Se me sale la babita
Yo no lo puedo evitar.
Cuando Juanica y Chan Chan
En el mar cernían arena
Como sacudía el ‘jibe’
A Chan Chan le daba pena.
Limpia el camino de paja
Que yo me quiero sentar
En aquel tronco que veo
Y así no puedo llegar.
De Alto Cedro voy para Marcané
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí.

(English)
I’m going from Alto Cedro
to Marcané
Then from Cueto, I’m going
to Mayarí. 
The love I have for you I cannot deny
My mouth is watering
I just can’t help myself.
When Juanika and Chan Chan
Sifted sand together on the beach
How her bottom shook and
Chan Chan was aroused!
Clean the dry sugar cane
leaves from the path
So I can get to that trunk
I want to sit down.
I’m going from Alto Cedro
to Marcané
Then from Cueto, I’m going
to Mayarí.

When I get home I lounge on my zef throne, mate
Mom after me cause I get so great

I can take you underworld lets go babe
When I step up and do my thing put you in a trance
My Zef motherfucking clique got it going on
Fuck what you think I do what I motherfucking want

Want jy lam innie mang, met jou slang in a man

Now why you loer en kyk gelyk?

You want to fight, you come tonight
Ek moer jou sleg! So jy hardloop weg

Pump your speakers, yo rock your body
In God we trust, You can't fuck with us

And my playboys, and my bad boys
And my pretty boys, and my ugly boys
And my naughty boys
We gonna have a nice time kids

The Story:

I've loved Com Truise's Komputer Casts since I first heard them, but I've always wanted to break them apart.  I wanted to skip the songs I didn't like.  I wanted to jump to the songs I couldn't get enough of.  I wanted to share parts with others, but the hour-long single-file format kept it from reaching its potential.

I started looking for others who had already done it.  I was surprised so few had tried, and discovered that simply cutting the mix into tracks wasn't good enough.

I started looking into the tracklists provided by Com Truise.  I was surprised they were so incomplete and filled with errors.  Sites like discogs.com mostly copied the errors, so there wasn't a place to get the definitive tracklisting with title and artist.

So, it started looking like I was going to have to do this myself.

Research, crate digging, collecting tracks, discovering artists, falling in love with library music... and here we are.  8 mixes' worth of the original tracks and extras.

Bonus Tracks:

By this time, I was already down the rabbit hole, so why not make everything available?  Extended movie clips.  VHS distribution company bumpers.  Reversed music.  Italian commercials.  Sesame Street.  I feel like every question has been answered.

Modifications:

Because the sources for these tracks were literally all over the map, I had to make some decisions - I apologize in advance.  I added one second of silence to the start and two at the end, with some fades in and out to make things neater.  I re-sampled all tracks to 320 kbps, just to prevent some tracks from bombing out on older systems and cars.  Lastly, I manually balanced the volume of most tracks to be as equal and as loud as I could, while trying not to damage fidelity.  Com Truise's tracks were already at 11, so I mostly left those alone.  Hopefully, I did a good enough job for you not to notice.

Cheers!

Lyrics:
Hey ho, lets go
hey ho, lets go
hey ho, lets go
hey ho, lets go

They're forming in straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The blitzkrieg bop

They're piling in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The blitzkrieg bop

Hey ho, lets go shootem in the back now
What they want, I dont know
They're all reved up and ready to go

They're forming in straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The blitzkrieg bop

They're piling in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The blitzkrieg bop

Hey ho, lets go shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I dont know
They're all reved up and ready to go

They're forming in straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The blitzkrieg bop

They're piling in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The blitzkrieg bop

Hey ho, lets go
hey ho, lets go
Hey ho, lets go
hey ho, lets go"

Release Text:
In this album, Donnie Moustaki takes us on a pleasure cruise through space. This journey, paced by a buttery flow, will guide you through a sea of cosmic jazziness and wonky grooves.

After a smooth launch with ‘Honey & Butter’, one of the finest cuisine will be brought to you by none other than Le Grand Détournement, in a collaborative effort with Donnie. ‘Tous Ensemble’, supported by a house beat with a heavy groove, will set you in the mood for the remixes coming next by the very talented SofaTalk, Scruscru and Last Nubian.

If you’re looking for a complex work, SofaTalk delivers a hefty rework of ‘Space Jam’ paced by broken rhythms and synthesizer licks.

If you’re looking for a dance floor track, the ‘Space Jam’ remix by Scruscru is made for you. Upbeat and joyful.

Last Nubian brings to the table a heavy club remix of ‘Space Jam’, driven by 808s and his signature dissonant harmonies.

The album ends on sample-filled, powerful ‘Space Jam’ remix by Berlin based producer Von Abseits. This well crafted work closes the album on a soothing yet slightly mysterious note, nodding at the narrative side of this album.

Label - Fresh Take 
Released - 12th March 2021
BUY FROM - https://freshtakerecords.bandcamp.com/album/you-know-how-it-goes

The delightful Belgian duo, Maxmoody, came to Fresh Take with an unbelievable, true, story.

As night settled into the busy city of Antwerp, Max and Moody made their way to a cosy bar, nestled in the centre of town. That night Detroit Swindle were due to spin some records. At the bar, they met a stranger, resulting in a night neither party would forget.

Four Ever makes up the flip side, which is a more traditional house outing. Rounding out the EP is a Midnight Dub re-rub of the lead track.

Dusky - Cold Heart is part of the 'Cold Heart' EP out on Dusky's very own 17 Steps imprint. 

Pre-order/Stream link: https://17steps.lnk.to/ColdHeart 

""Dusky present the latest 17 Steps release with the ’Cold Heart EP’, a four track package that cements their ability to craft a unique range of house and techno soundscapes.

Having spent last year releasing their ‘Outer’ LP, as well as delivering their second acclaimed Essential Mix and touring a new live show, the ‘Cold Heart EP’ sees the prolific duo return to their roots in textured house and techno with four powerful DJ tools.

With a nod to vintage New York house through a carefully sourced vocal sample, lead track ‘Cold Heart’ is a blissed out, atmospheric house epic that blends crisp percussion, soulful hooks, washing pads and a hypnotic lead organ melody.

A favourite from the duo’s recent DJ sets, ‘Psychic Life Coach’ shuffles with dubby grooves, skippy drums and ethereal vocal cut-ups, before ‘Bowed’ offers a high energy dose of cosmic disco and ravey techno flavours, Rounding things off, closing track ‘Balfour Betty’ is built around warm, swirling synth textures that meet at the intersection of Detroit techno and vintage progressive trance.""

Release Text:
For GLBDOM Classic’s third release we present you Katermurr. This young talent from Switzerland provides the ""Warm Night"" EP, which brings us back to the roots of House music.

The EP starts with “It Ain’t What You Got"", a rough jackin house track with organ stabs, complemented by a sample of a Moodymann interview in which he spits some facts about making music.
The track ""Warm Night"", which gives name to the EP, is a combination of deep chords and a driving rhythm section. It creates the image of a hazy summer night in the city, swirling neon lights and people drinking in bars.
""Deeper Gruv"" - melding deep chords with a jackin bass line reminiscing the atmosphere of classic New York House.
This release also includes a loungy, jazzy and elegant remix by DJ MERCI.

Release Text:
Russian Indie Dance / Nu Disco and House label Soviett return with the 4th vinyl release of their club-friendly series «Plastinka»! Ranging from 108 to 124 BPM this time, all four tracks are full-length DJ-versions exclusive to this vinyl and never been available before. «Patchouly Indonesiano» by Saint-Petersburg-based Pavel Korzhensky, aka Ksky, is a lively piece of modern analogue electro. Alexander Prosvetov, aka Marco Lazovic from Moscow, delivers an atmospheric tech-house track with a strong retro feeling of the 80s and 90s dance music scene; it emphasizes how deeply Lazovic explores the roots of electronica. Street Choice is a Russian duo of Artyom Vasiliev and Alexander Rodakov; the guys present a classic house production with a humming rhythm section and a memorable piano line on top. Buzz Compass is Andrey Bychenkov and his «Make A Baby» is a perfect laid back start to an evening pre-party with lots of live instruments and no rush. Plastinka 4 is a proper addition to your current vinyl DJ-set or personal listening pleasure!

House legend, Niles Cooper jumps aboard the ROOS train with four glistening floor fillers on Notes From The Underground. After a 2020 that saw him self release a genre-spanning debut album as well as an EP on Kerri Chandler’s Madhouse, and previous releases on his own label, Pale Springs Records, the Danish producer lands on Lobster Theremin affiliate label, Running Out Of Steam.The twinkling keys & uplifting vocals of Florida Keys transport you right to the riviera while Oldtown Dubs scattered sax licks and bouncy chords make for a more floor-oriented affair. On the flip, stripped-down piano cut My House ramps up the energy while 6.A.M. Sunrise is a warm cruise to the end of the record. ‘Notes From The Underground’ drops Friday 26th February, via Running Out Of Steam."

Ripped from the rare digital release as a disc 2 with the album ""The Meaning""



""When Thomas Melchior launched his aspect label in London at the turn of the millennium, he wanted to further establish a new platform and identity. The beginnings of which had been pioneered as Soul Capsule and M-Core as well as his previous label Softcore records. This unique vision saw a stripped down, rhythmical, sexy after hour house with the underlying elements of the sensitive, blissful and profound. Wrapped up in a subtle and minimal production. It would allow the beats and the music to be revealed under the right circumstances, at the right time to the discerning dancer and listener, sucking him down into the mental, hypnotic grooves, voices and atmospheres emanating mystery and depth: ""destination micro funk heaven"". this was the theory and the tracks existed, but when originally released, as a classy looking various pseudonyms double 12"", asc 1+2 received little recognition, neither did soul capsule's ""Law of Grace"" (asc 3) in 2001. This it seemed aspect was to be forgotten, until playhouse released Melchior Productions' ""Let's Go Deep"" and ""no elevador"" ep's that interest was shown into the short history of aspect music. Finally it seems fitting to add these three important and influential releases (for the first time on cd), culminating as a form of prelude and retrospective, for Melchior Productions album ""The Meaning"".

It's V.A.-time over at Aterral Records. The exquisite curation thats been introduced by the labels previous catalogue of five solo artist EPs now evidently constitutes this first compilation release, joining Aterral mainstays with new inductees and upcoming talents. So you'll witness Black Loops kicking it off with a pristine atmospheric and bassline driven groove called ""Cheesy AF"". A tune that, in all smart- and deepness, displays a compelling take-no-prisoners-attitude. Then Aterral honcho Carlo takes over with the over-modestly titled ""This Song Will Age Terribly"" - a breeze-like sonic refreshment taking some unexpected turns and, contrary to what the title suggests, going for the long lasting impact. Then there is Belgian producer Bass Toast, handing in a percussively and rhythmically advanced, yet deeply soulful piece named ""Tribute To Ljubljana"". Spanish duo Dan Be & Techniscje Loef deliver classic Deephouse of the most captivating sort in ""Missing Piece"", leaving you clueless about what piece they are talking about, since it's just all there. And finally Italian producer Niccolò Turini is closing things off with ""Frangia"" a pad-kissed dream made of a funky bassline, playful leads and blissful field recordings.

The Verse (total stab in the dark on this one) by Pedro Camacho
Previously uploaded components as ""Orbit"", ""Synth Action"" and ""Caterpillar""

This one vast track is at the core of 2.6's new dynamic music system, and was found in the files for 2.6 PTU. A big thanks to CitizenEleven for providing access. This track comprises of three distinct segments, two of which were partly present in 2.5 (""Orbit"" and ""Synth Action""), and the new third one found only in 2.6 was used in the ships video on the 2946 Anniversary Livestream (""Caterpillar""). There are transition stems between these three segments to form a huge dynamic track. As far as I can tell, this hub track is only used for pedestrian activities (on foot/FPS/EVA etc) rather than for spaceflight. I've tried to represent as many of the stems as possible in this upload, this contains 27 of the 29 that I could find. The missing two are a 5 second transition from ""Orbit"" to ""Synth Action"" and the bare percussion from ""Caterpillar"", so you're really not missing much. :P

Making movements that didn’t go 
I never chose not to have a body in my head
So how does it feel not to of had someone touch you for twenty two years? 
Don’t ask me
I’m not supposed to know what that’s like
Sort of maybe 
Actually yes 

Whilst humans are problematic
I’ll explore different things that tell me I’m subjective
And I don’t want to go there but I still keep on going there
And every night I dream and wake up wishing it wasn’t a dream
You can ship wreck the moor away
Oh everybody hates being alone
I’ve got blood all over my leg
What the fuck do you want from me now? 

Lullaby 
Sing me a lullaby 
Lullaby
Sing me a lullaby
An exhausting lullaby
A lonely Lullaby 
One that goes on and on...
I never chose an exhausting lullaby
By the lake we decided this is our place 
I just wish I could have some happy times 
I never chose an exhausting lullaby 
A lonely Lullaby

Royal Blood – Lights Out Lyrics

Every time I’m with it alone
It picks me up
You just send me down
I can feel it rushing under my skin
You’re a cage won’t you let me in?
On my toes
Lock the door
Pretty face
Through the walls
Don’t know if I’d be so sure again
I think I’ve found it my only friend

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You’re not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

Every time I’m stuck in the ground
Spin me round, won’t you spin me round
You’re a void, a crack in the mirror
See me now, if you could see me now
You slipped through
The night
Then walked out
Skin tight
But you don’t matter that much to me
No you don’t matter that much to me

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You’re not so hard to forget
With all the lights out
So turn the lights out
Just turn the lights out

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You’re not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

About Royal Blood

Brighton duo Royal Blood comprising drummer Ben Thatcher and bassist/vocalist Mike Kerr formed at the beginning of 2013. They quickly made their presence known, with pounding drums and heavily distorted bass guitar defining characteristics of their ferocious blues-rock sound. The band gained many plaudits early in their career, touring with the likes of Arctic Monkeys, Iggy Pop and Foo Fighters, before going on to win Best British Group at the Brits in 2015 receiving their trophy from their musical hero and admirer Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page.

Their catalogue boasts the Mercury Prize nominated self-titled debut album released in 2014 that spawned hits such as ""Out of the Black, ""Little Monster:, ""Come On Over"" and ""Figure it Out"", as well as their second successive UK number one album ""How Did We Get So Dark?"" released in 2017 which featured ""Lights Out"" and ""I Only Lie When I Love You"".

(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)

Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you said so
I'd have to pack my things and go (That's right)

(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)

Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
(You ain't got no money you just ain't no good)
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go (That's right)

(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)

Well
(Don't you come back no more)
Uh, what you say?
(Don't you come back no more)
I didn't understand you
(Don't you come back no more)
You can't mean that
(Don't you come back no more)
Oh, now baby, please

Lyrics:

I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by

I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying
""I love you""

I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh yeah

Lyrics:

If you want to take my body tonight
Then you got to be somebody tonight
Use me just to make your body feel right
If you want to take my body tonight

Well God killed the queen 
My body tonight
Well God killed the queen
My body tonight

Oh yeah

I think I'm seeing double
I think I'm seeing double
God takes time and money 
I think I'm seeing double
He never made a dime on me
I think I'm seeing double

If you want to take my body tonight (I think I'm seeing double)
Then you got to be somebody tonight (I think I'm seeing double)
Use me just to make your body feel right (I think I'm seeing double)
God killed the Queen

For case up (I'll probably take) 
Well count it 
Well count it
Well count it (My body tonight)
Well count it

Well I don't know what I'm doing here

So she's so loaded 

5, 6 time on me (I think I'm seeing double)
God takes time on me (I think I'm seeing double)
He never made a dime on me (Wait till you're seeing it)

I think I'm seeing double
I think I'm seeing double
Use me just to make your body feel right (I think I'm seeing double)

Well God killed the Queen"

Release Text:
How to turn a moment of worry, uncertainty, and isolation into something of a warm-hearted, creative catalyst? How to build bridges when humanity in its entirety seems caught in the nets of decisively painful crossroads? Written and recorded during the lockdown that has put our civilisations to sleep for the past year, the new album from Third Attempt comes as a much welcome balmy treat to our existentially dreadful times.
Dishing out good vibes in copious amounts, the aptly named 'Beats From The Quarantine' finds Third Attempt doing what he does best, i.e. pushing low-slung trip-hop joints and reframed disco blends on a loungey tip. An idyllic opener, 'Addicted' gets the ball rolling in soothing, dreamy fashion - grooving out to a plush, slap-heavy bounce that'll get your hips swaying and feet shuffling without further ado. Channeling polychromatic urban energies, the sample-heavy 'Front To The Back' then serves up a crisp mix of hip-hop drums, fluttering melodies and nu-age-friendly flights steering us closer to organic sound folds.
A heavily dubbed-out jazzy affair, 'Make It Double' stresses an intricate mixture of brass-laden jamming, wistful piano chords and smokey funk bass, all resounding across a dense haze of FX and subtle textural arrangements that grow deeper as bars pass by. Drifting towards more ethereally soulful heights, the brittle 'Missing Feeling' has us teleported to poetic jazz dreamlands in a snap of the finger. Fusing a solid bass with lush flocks of mischievous woodblocks and otherworldly chimes, the track floats in a zone of its own, just as eerily lavish as it is invitingly emotional.
Fuelled on laid-back trip-hop and vibraphonic kosmische, downtempo chugger 'Please Hold' quietly rides on to greener spiritual pastures, whilst 'Rain' reels out a more aqueous swing - mustering a breezy yet introspective package of sonar-like bloops, luxuriant disco shades and dusky Floridian atmospherics. Upping the tempo drastically, 'Images' keeps the feels pouring but tweaks the whole into a further hectic acid-drenched second half. Tapping into traditional Hindu motifs, 'Mirage' is a deeper-than-deep mystic trip, catching its listener in hypnotic webs of sitar-imbued harmonics. 
Breathable to the fullest, 'Air' eases us in moody balearic jazz territories again through finely woven flights of languid trumpets and polychromatic pads, paying a nice tribute to the late José Padilla's evergreen melodic touch. One to curl up and drift off to, closing cut 'Cocoon' wraps us in warm layers of piano and synth-strewn accordance, fitting somewhere between the prismatic beauty of Aphex Twin's Drukqs-ian excursions and further sun-kissed Ibizean magic.

Label - Yakra Sound
Released - 29th April 2021
BUY FROM - https://yakrasound.bandcamp.com/

Tom Arkay delivers the first release of Yakra Sound with his Episodio One EP. It includes 3 original tracks and a remix by French producer Ringard (Dance Around 88 - /RAW/). The two first tracks are highly influenced by the 90's House sound of New York with funky vocals on Episodio One while le Vilain has a deeper resonance. Zangief has a slightly different sound signature, bringing heavier groove and a faster BMP. Ringard enhanced this EP with a Dub treatment on Episodio One which adds a trip hop flavor to the track.

LYRICS

""Se leggera ti farai, io sarò vento
per darti il mio sostegno senza fingere
se distanza ti farai, io sarò asfalto
impronta sui tuoi passi senza stringere mai.



Se battaglia ti farai, io starò al fianco
per darti il mio sorriso senza fingere
se dolore ti farai, io starò attento
a ricucire i tagli senza stringere mai.

FUORI È UN GIORNO FRAGILE
MA TUTTO QUI CADE INCANTEVOLE 
COME QUANDO RESTI CON ME
FUORI È UN MONDO FRAGILE
MA TUTTO QUI CADE INCANTEVOLE 
COME QUANDO RESTI CON ME.

Se innocenza ti farai, io sarò fango
che tenta la tua pelle senza bruciare.
Se destino ti farai, io sarò pronto
per tutto ciò che è stato a non rimpiangere mai.

FUORI È UN GIORNO FRAGILE
MA TUTTO QUI CADE INCANTEVOLE 
COME QUANDO RESTI CON ME
FUORI È UN MONDO FRAGILE
MA TUTTO QUI CADE INCANTEVOLE 
COME QUANDO RESTI CON ME.

Fuori è un giorno fragile
fuori è un mondo fragile.
Fuori è un giorno fragile
fuori è un mondo fragile.

FUORI È UN GIORNO FRAGILE
MA TUTTO QUI CADE INCANTEVOLE 
COME QUANDO RESTI CON ME
FUORI È UN MONDO FRAGILE
MA TUTTO QUI CADE INCANTEVOLE 
COME QUANDO RESTI CON ME.
FUORI È UN GIORNO FRAGILE
MA TUTTO QUI CADE INCANTEVOLE, 
COME QUANDO
RESTI CON ME

Fuori è un giorno fragile
Fuori è un mondo fragile
Fuori è un giornofragile
Fuori è un mondo fragile"""

LYRICS

""This must be underwater love
The way I feel it slipping all over me
This must be underwater love
The way I feel it

O que que é esse amor, d'água
Deve sentir muito parecido a esse amor
This is it
Underwater love
It is so deep
So beautifully liquid

Esse amor com paixão, ai
Esse amor com paixão, ai que coisa

After the rain comes sun
After the sun comes rain again
After the rain comes sun
After the sun comes rain again

This must be underwater love
The way I feel it slipping all over me
This must be underwater love
The way I feel it

O que que é esse amor, d'água
Eu sei que eu não quero mais nada

Follow me now
To a place you only dream of
Before I came along

When I first saw you
I was deep in clear blue water
The sun was shining
Calling me to come and see you
I touched your soft skin
And you jumped in with your eyes closed
And a smile upon your face
Você vem, você vai
Você vem e cai
E vem aqui pra cá
Porque eu quero te beijar na sua boca
Que coisa louca
Vem aqui pra cá
Porque eu quero te beijar na sua boca
Ai que boca gostosa

After the rain comes sun
After the sun comes rain again
After the rain comes sun
After the sun comes rain again
Cai cai e tudo tudo cai
Tudo cai pra lá e pra cá
Pra lá e pra cá
E vamos nadar
Y vamos nadar e tudo tudo dá

This must be underwater love
The way I feel it slipping all over me
This must be underwater love
The way I feel it
Oh oh d'água we are full

Underwater
Oh underwater love
This underwater love
This underwater love
Underwater love"""

For the fourth opus on his self-titled label, Kool Vibe calls on the service of talented Washerman, Sunny Galaxy & Inner Sense to deliver 4 tracks with deep, garage & groovy overtones which are definitely meant for the dance floor . One aim ever: paying tribute to Jersey, NYC & Chicago vibes of the 90's. Special mention: the collaboration of Aaron Smith, the legendary remixer/producer and former member of UBQ Project duet alongside Terry Hunter, with a groovy keyboard solo on Inner Sense's ""4 Aaron & Terry"" track.

BUY FROM - https://felipegordon.bandcamp.com/album/a-landscape-onomatopeya-lp

Hot on the heels of two EP releases on Bristol label Shall Not Fade, Felipe Gordon is preparing for the release of his debut album on the important UK imprint. With human contact at an absolute minimum, it’s refreshing to hear an electronic music record that ventures away from the machine in favor of the organic. Gordon’s ability to blend complex jazz instrumentation with acid-licked basslines, golden-age house aesthetics and the cultural sounds of South America is unrivaled; creating distinctive, beautiful and exciting house records from his home in the Colombian capital of Bogota.

Founded in 2014 by Joss moog, Around7 (also producers for Robsoul Recordings) & House lover Jean Cé (aka SFD), the new Parisian label, Ondulé Recordings,  wants to offer a quality sound attached to the roots of house music. 
Deeply inspired by disco, funk, soul/jazz & hip hop, Ondulé will offer a wide range of electronic music to listen to from the couch to the dancefloor, having always one word in mind: GROOVE!!   
We could say deep house, jacking house, nu disco, down tempo… but it doesn't matter after all, Ondulé Recordings has to be a shelter for freedom in music. 
As the name of the label indicates (""Ondulé"" stands for ""Wavy"" in English), what we think today might not be what we'll think tomorrow: Ondulé's music  needs to make you undulate.

The boys from Munich are back on RNT with a 4-tracker of serious flavor! 'Express Lane' launches the 12” on the disco highway for a wild ride of cheeky vocals, horn stabs, and vocoded synths, then veers south for some North-African New Wave with 'Libyan Sun'. The B side kicks off with the Afro-disco monster 'Don’t Oho', already a staple in RNT sets and then finishes with the minimalist electro-soul bounce of 'Emergency Loop'. Sure-shots, the lot of 'em!

https://toytonics.bandcamp.com/album/illegal-jazz-vol-3

Previews: https://soundcloud.com/delfonic/sets/illegal-jazz-vol-3-toye003

Illegal Jazz is a limited edition vinyl Edit series of former OYE records music impresario & king of Berlin’s vinyl diggers DELFONIC and Toy Tonics records boss, DJ, vinyl collector and music nerd KAPOTE. 

Both have a heavy passion for danceable jazz tunes and a massive collection of rare vinyl, so they decided to start this irregular series of edits called ILLEGAL JAZZ where they rework 60ies and 70ies Jazz tunes in a way that they are playable for today's advanced DJs.

Part 1 and 2 have been sold out immediately and played by many DJs from Honey Dijon and Jazzanova to UK Radio DJs like Gilles Peterson, Sarah Evans or Tina Edwards. Virgil Abloh also already featured some of the tracks. So it makes sense to go on and this is part 3.

New release on Ibadan Records: ""You're In My System"" by Kerri Chandler & Jerome Sydenham ft. Troy Denari remixed by Dennis Quin Amsterdam-based DJ and producer Dennis Quin and original vocalist Troy Denari breathe new life into Ibadan's classic house track.

Ibadan announces the release of a new remix by Dennis Quin of Kerri Chandler & Jerome Sydenham ft. Troy Denari - You're In My System on August 2, 2019.

Quin, a self-professed house addict and die-hard Kerri Chandler fan since the early nineties, had been searching for a new vocalist to work with. He turned to Simon Birkumshaw, label manager and A&R of Chandler's Madhouse Records, who recommended Troy Denari, the new vocalist of the classic Ibadan track ""You're In My System"". When Denari revealed that had just resung the vocals, Quin was inspired to remix the track.

Quin's aim with this remix was to update the track for his sets and give it contemporary production values in line with his current energetic sets. It's always tricky to put your hands on a huge record like this, he says. It's a legendary track that everyone knows, so I was extremely careful in terms of mixing, timing, and all the rest.The result is a modern version of the classic that is very true to the original. At the same time, Quin makes his mark by bringing his own drum and percussion into the mix.

The remix versions cover all the bases, including atmospheric dub, club and instrumental mixes, plus a special three-minute edit for Spotify.

Working together for the first time, the members of the musical team were excited to exchange their ideas. Troy, Kerri, Jerome and I have gained so much out this intense collaboration. It has developed into a deep friendship that is all about house music, good vibes and pride in our achievements. Each of us is fulfilled by our individual roles in this project. I'm really proud to be part of this family.

Christine Pedersen, managing director of Ibadan Records, is excited about Quin's first release on the label. It came highly recommended from Kerri and we have been following Dennis for some years. And it's always a pleasure to welcome new and talented collaborators into the fold. And I love the new vocal. Troy's singing brings a fresh spin to the track.

World Class - the new full-length from Luxury Elite - is the essential soundtrack to such a film; a love letter to ‘80s America, smooth jazz, lounge music and skyscraper skylines by night. Vaporwave is often greeted with the same nose-up attitudes as chillwave and witch house before it, but with World Class, Luxury Elite demonstrates that there’s more to the genre than just putting a few samples together. Opener ‘S.W.A.K.’ is a bold, funk-filled pop song; the hazy ‘Upscale’ a shimmering slice of Balearic that’s as appropriate for late night, open-top drives as it is for sipping a cold one on a faraway beach."" -DIY Magazine

what is jazz?
Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part. In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up on the spot, which requires considerable skill. Jazz can express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy. In jazz, you may hear the sounds of freedom-for the music has been a powerful voice for people suffering unfair treatment because of the color of the skin, or because they lived in a country run by a cruel dictator.

Forget your sorrow, let it all fade away.
Forget tomorrow, let's start living for today.
Let me take you through a night of ecstasy
I like to hear the sound of a mystic melody.
In the spotlight with the music playing loud
No distraction together we have found.
Let me show you all the glamour and the gold
Secret fantasies in a show biz world.
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all night
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls
You got to have 'rhythm'.

When ever you're dancing and you glide across the floor
Your heart is singing and they're calling out for more
Let me take you through a night of ecstasy.
I like to hear the sound of a mystic melody.
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all night
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all night
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls.
Give me rhythm.

Forget your sorrow, let it all fade away.
Forget tomorrow, let's start living for today
Let me show you all the glamour and the gold
Secret fantasies in a show biz world.
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all night
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all n'ght
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls.
Give me rhythm. - Give me -
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all night

The Notorious B.I.G. channel is the official YouTube home of The Notorious B.I.G. featuring his catalog of official music videos. The Notorious B.I.G. is widely recognized as one of the world’s most influential rappers and has sold more than 17 million albums in the U.S. alone. Before his murder in 1997, Christopher Wallace recorded two classic albums as The Notorious B.I.G. His debut Ready to Die arrived in 1994 and helped revitalize the East Coast rap scene with massive hits like “Big Poppa” and “Juicy.” Life After Death was released in March 1997 just weeks after he was shot and killed in Los Angeles. The record topped the U.S. album charts and featured the hits “Hypnotize” and “Mo Money Mo Problems.” It remains one of the few hip-hop albums to ever achieve Diamond certification from the RIAA."

This is a compilation of 19 unreleased background tracks from the show Samurai Champloo. The raw material was originally compiled by reddit users AMALGAM, TheeFrenzy and sndrnchd. I remastered and extended the tracks for this unofficial release in order to preserve the unheard work of Fat Jon, Nujabes, Tsutchie and Force of Nature on the soundtrack. I hope you enjoy it.

R.I.P. Jay Dee!

James Dewitt Yancey (February 7, 1974  February 10, 2006), better known by the stage names J Dilla and Jay Dee, was an American Grammy Nominated record producer who emerged from the mid-1990s underground hip hop scene in Detroit, Michigan.

Yancey's career began slowly. He has now become highly regarded, most notably for the production of critically acclaimed albums by Common, Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest, and The Pharcyde. He was a member of Slum Village for their acclaimed debut album Fantastic, Vol. 2.

In the early 2000s, Yancey's career as a solo artist began to improve; A solo album Welcome 2 Detroit was followed by a collaborative album with California producer Madlib, Champion Sound, which catalyzed the careers of both artists. Just as his music was becoming increasingly popular, Yancey died in 2006 of the blood disease TTP."

EP Title: Interflow EP
Release Date: September 2020

Interflow EP is the second studio EP by English producer Joe Newham on Houseum Records, released under his stage name Gavinco. The album's musical style is described as a synthesis or musical library of electronic sounds incorporated with the acid jazz instrumentation.

This EP is a collection of five tracks starting with the hypnotic yes transient track 'Much Love' with the singer Abela. The second track 'Regards' brings up the motion in the EP. That takes you on a tropical yet tantalizing trip with the solo piano riffs and arithmetic glockenspiel.

Third is 'Interflow' with the long lasting journey of muted trumpets and saxophone riffs that are accompanied by the live instrumentation of drum and bongo. We then move on to the fourth track 'Movate', this track pushes you back out into the dance groove with the heavy live bass recording that has been incorporated into the old school electronic 4/4 house rhythm.

Finally we finish with the bonus digital track 'Imagination' with the upbeat disco drum pattern and lavish ballroom style of house music.

What A Wonderful World

I see trees of green, red roses, too 

I see them bloom, for me and you 
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world. 

I see skies of blue, and clouds of white, 
The bright blessed day, 
The dark sacred night 
And I think to myself, 
What a wonderful world. 

The colour of the rainbow, 
So pretty in the sky 
Are also on the faces, 
Of people going by 
I see friends shaking hands, 
Saying ""How do you do?"" 
They're really sayin': ""I love you"". 

I hear babies cry, 
I watch them grow, 
They'll learn much more, 
Than I'll ever know 
And I think to myself, 
What a wonderful world, 
Yes, I think to myself, 
What a wonderful world"

PREMIERE on Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/2QzMjZu

Label: Houseum Records
Artist: Gavinco
Format: Vinyl (500 copies) & Digital
Cat Number: HSM007
EP Title: Interflow EP
Release Date: September 2020

Interflow EP is the second studio EP by English producer Joe Newham on Houseum Records, released under his stage name Gavinco. The album's musical style is described as a synthesis or musical library of electronic sounds incorporated with the acid jazz instrumentation.

This EP is a collection of five tracks starting with the hypnotic yes transient track 'Much Love' with the singer Abela. The second track 'Regards' brings up the motion in the EP. That takes you on a tropical yet tantalizing trip with the solo piano riffs and arithmetic glockenspiel.

Third is 'Interflow' with the long lasting journey of muted trumpets and saxophone riffs that are accompanied by the live instrumentation of drum and bongo. We then move on to the fourth track 'Movate', this track pushes you back out into the dance groove with the heavy live bass recording that has been incorporated into the old school electronic 4/4 house rhythm.

Finally we finish with the bonus digital track 'Imagination' with the upbeat disco drum pattern and lavish ballroom style of house music.

IfVmFkjsUtc,Chic ~ I Want Your Love 1978 Disco Purrfection Version,821,9874510,DJDiscoCat,DJDiscoCatV2,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7NzN_pjO1o1eoR_dhaUSg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfVmFkjsUtc,"It's been 40 years since when this was #1 on the Disco chart for 7 weeks starting the week ending November 25, up to December 30, 1978 when the combo of Le Freak"", ""Chic Cheer"" and ""I Want Your Love"" ruled the clubs. A seriously funky disco song with a groove that never ends, it doesn't build and break like the anthemic ""Le Freak"" but  has this hypnotizing mix of polyrhythms that intoxicate, hypnotize and invigorate. 


I hope you like this new extended remix, I really enjoyed putting this one together...the fabulous and famous Chic string section open this sinuously sexy song  remix of want and need, something we can all relate to. I love the strings in this one, so beautifully produced and performed by three women who are Cheryl Hong, Karen Milne and Marianne Carroll. They played on every Chic project starting with 1978's ""C'est Chic"" all the way to ""Real People"" in 1980, Sheila & B Devotion's ""Spacer"" and on Johnny Mathis' stillborn Chic produced ""I Love My Lady"" that finally saw official release in 2019. 


The new style the boys used for Johnny Mathis was more subdued and perfect for the time, but Mathis' manager and label felt that it did not advance his career and that he was barely recognizable. I think that it would have been a hit, revitalizing Johnny's career and the remixes would have been out of this world had they gone ahead with the project back in 1980. Promo versions on vinyl made their way to some DJ's, notably Tee Scott who famously played some of the tracks on his radio show and then bootlegs were being passed around the internet for years. There even was a website that had some of the tracks uploaded so you could listen to them and they finally got all the tracks up there some time ago, a few years before the official release of a few songs from  ""I Love My Lady"" that made its appearance on  Nile Rodgers Presents The Chic Organization* - Box Set Vol. 1 / ""Savoir Faire"" in 2010. I for one would still love to hear the demo for ""Le Freak"" with all its expletive deleted glory."

Underworld is a symbolic allegory about two lovers living in two separate dimensions. Separate by a higher power, they find each other at a different level in the world but strangely connected in a special and unique way. The only memory they have from the other is a bust and some objects that interrelate them and keep the flame alive despite of the impossiblity of their reunion.

Eton Messy have now fully arrived as some of the most influential tastemakers in the dance world. What started as a YouTube channel has evolved into a label, party series and production outfit that unearths and offers the freshest house, electronica, chill and lounge music to devoted fans everywhere. 

Early on the Eton Messy collective were early supporters of breakthrough artists like Blonde, Bondax and Maribou State. Their monthly mixes picked up a huge following around the world and as such demand for them to DJ around the globe became huge. They now do so each weekend and also host their own stages at various key festivals, as well as leading from the from the front with their Eton Messy label which has even lead to multiple takeovers on on BBC Radio 1. 

Releases from Jack Bandit, Just Kiddin, The Golden Boy and many more have all helped established it as an essential outlet for the newest sounds, and their new In: Season compilation once again proves they have their finger well and truly on the pulse.  Support for Eton Messy comes from not only from fellow Djs and dancers all over the world, but also those in the know such as BBC Radio 1 icons Annie Mac, Pete Tong, Danny Howard and Monki.

Polytonality continues - Matthias Vogt is back with part 2 of his 3-EP's series on Polytone. And again he is stying true of his concept of versitality. Three all different clubtracks: ""The Nine-O-Nineties"" - the title is saying it all already - pairs an impulsive 909 techno groove with 90s trademark rave sounds. Stripped down and organic. ""Camino"" is a sample based minimal groover, building up for quite a while, then uncovering its jazzy latin-infused magic. Finally ""Alone Together"": classic soulful deep musicality - stacked vintage keyboard chords are meeting an upright bass.

Tosca has been curating quality remixes for for as long as the duo has releasing music together. On Tlapa, a collection of remixes from the most recent LP Odeon, Richard Dorfmeister & Rupert Huber gathered artists capable of complementing the originals with a fresh take, rather than riding the waves of the latest electronic music trend. With contributions from their extended artistic circle, including Brendon Moeller, Rainer Trüby, Joyce Muniz, and many others, Tlapa is a showcase for the versatility of the original compositions, and the talents of an expertly selected group of producers."

Anime: Cowboy Bebop
OST: Cowboy Bebop OST 2 No Disc (1998)
[audio]

Cowboy Bebop (カウボーイビバップ, Kaubōi Bibappu) is a Japanese animated television series. Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and written by Keiko Nobumoto, Cowboy Bebop was produced by Sunrise. Consisting of 26 episodes, the series follows the adventures of a group of bounty hunters traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop, in the year 2071.

Cowboy Bebop was a commercial success both in Japan and international markets, notably in the United States. After this reception, Sony Pictures released a feature film, Knockin' on Heaven's Door to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international DVD release. Two manga adaptations were serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX.

Cowboy Bebop has been strongly influenced by American music, especially the jazz movements of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and the early rock era of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its action sequences, from space battles to hand-to-hand martial arts combat, are set and timed to music. Following the musical theme, episodes are called Sessions, and titles are often borrowed from album or song names (such as Sympathy for the Devil or My Funny Valentine), or make use of a genre name (""Mushroom Samba"") indicating a given episode's musical theme.
