Illegal Jazz is a limited edition vinyl Edit series of former OYE records music impresario & king of Berlin’s vinyl diggers DELFONIC and Toy Tonics records boss, DJ, vinyl collector and music nerd KAPOTE. 

Both have a heavy passion for danceable jazz tunes and a massive collection of rare vinyl, so they decided to start this irregular series of edits called ILLEGAL JAZZ where they rework 60ies and 70ies Jazz tunes in a way that they are playable for today's advanced DJs.

Part 1 and 2 have been sold out immediately and played by many DJs from Honey Dijon and Jazzanova to UK Radio DJs like Gilles Peterson, Sarah Evans or Tina Edwards. Virgil Abloh also already featured some of the tracks. So it makes sense to go on and this is part 3.

Producer & DJ Mall Grab has announced his new EP ‘How The Dogs Chill, Vol. 1’, on his brand new imprint ‘Looking For Trouble.’  

The new release arrives ahead of Mall Grab’s upcoming ‘Looking For Trouble' tour, including a London headline show on 6th October at E1.

The 25 year old’s latest record follows one of last summer’s biggest house releases - 'Pool Party Music’ on DJ Haus’s ever-excellent Hot Haus Recs, as well as a collaborative EP earlier this year alongside Loods on Steel City Dance Discs, the label he runs with his friends Jarred Kennedy and Jackson Fitzsimmons. Having emerged in 2015 with the infectious ‘Feel U’ EP, the strength and evolution of Jordon’s productions has firmly established him as one of dance music’s most exciting talents.

The new EP arrives in the middle of another busy period for Mall Grab.  Having played well over 100 shows in the last year, he just curated the London event Long Live Southbank - a one off fundraiser party supporting the restoration of Southbank’s hallowed Undercroft skate space, which was streamed by Boiler Room. Having grown up skateboarding the event’s cause was a particularly special one for Jordon. About to embark on his much anticipated ‘Looking For Trouble’ tour throughout September and October and with more shows through November & December in Japan and Australia, Mall Grab will close out 2018 on a high."

Originally from Bristol UK, Ben J Worrall aka Crackazat is a musician, producer and composer, with a formal background in jazz composition. Now relocated to Sweden, where he releases through the Local Talk label, his productions and remixes have been gaining support from Disclosure, Detroit Swindle, Homework.

For his Period Works EP for ZR he searched the extensive catalogue of ZR accapella's and blended parts of them to create three slamming new productions.

""Universal Love"" hits the right balance between the classic house sound and Crackazat's trademark warm, jazzy take on electronic music. ""What You're Feeling"" heads into more classic piano house territory with low-slung disco beats, while ""Crystal Eyes"" goes for futuristic chords with funk led guitars over a big bass groove.

DJ Reactions:

Groove Armada - Great release, really musical, diggin’ these

Opolopo - Crackazat is at it with the quality stuff again!

A1. Nite Fleit - Hot Bot
A2. Mall Grab - Reconnaissance
B1. Mall Grab, Nite Fleit - Anatomy of the Senses
B2. Mall Grab, Nite Fleit - Moogie
—

LFT003 is an introduction to the music that Jordon Alexander (Mall Grab) and long-time friend, housemate and sometimes-DJ-partner Alysha Fleiter (Nite Fleit) have worked on over the past year together. The product of swapping stems on tour, trains and at home, the ‘Moogie’ EP combines two individual and two collaborative tracks for the third release on the Looking For Trouble label.

After destroying dance floors worldwide, Nite Fleit’s “Hot Bot” finally sees the light of day at A1. With EBM-leaning atmospheric percussion and a huge pulsating bassline, this is a proven peak time club weapon.

Mall Grab’s “Reconnaissance” (A2) is another club-geared stomper with a throbbing bassline and breakbeat homage that operates deep within old-skool rave territory. Having made its mark as an unidentified dub in all of MG’s sets over the past year, “Reconnaissance” is now ready to be unleashed!

B1, “Anatomy of the Senses”, the collaborative debut from Nite Fleit and Mall Grab, is a promising introduction to future products of this fusion. With NF’s signature evolving and pulsing basslines/synthesis, and MG’s distinct drum programming/synth licks, this trance-acid-tekno 4/4 stomper is an unapologetic body-shaker.

Closing off the record, “Moogie” (B2) is the second official melding of the minds of NF + MG, an electronica-leaning electro number that feels as at home in headphones as it does on a packed dance floor."

🗣️ A collection of dubs, demos, club tools and noises from the mind of Jordy.

I'm lucky enough to have the means to support and collaborate with my friends who work hard to follow their dreams and passions, this is dedicated to them and everyone out there listening.
The profits from these 20 tracks will be used to support those in need during this challenging ordeal.

Dance around in your room, play it loud, stay safe and support the ones you love - and even the ones you don't, because positive energy will always win.

Some of these will eventually be released over a couple of 12""s.

Fine Mode is closing the year with a long awaited drop by our favorite San Diego based DJ and producer, Jesusdapnk. ""Another Venture"" is a follow up release to his Venture EP, which was our first release of 2020.
This 2 track EP projects his more experimental side, but at the same time, it features his signature sound, substance and spacey vibes. Despite of all the 2020 tragedies, we are grateful to all artists and music lovers who have been supporting us as always. We wish you all a brighter future and a 2021 filled with blessings and success.

French superstar, D.ko Label bossman and all-round bemasked mystery Mézigue brings the heat on this special release for skylax records. His style is uncommon & raw, mézigue is doing mézigue style, take it or leave it. If you're listening carfeully to his music you can imagine a dream mix between the absurd poetry of the pixies crossed with the craziness of Mr Oizo.This is one of the weirdest release we have ever signed and we are so proud of, unusual & unique. Mézigue is here to stay."

« Le Meilleur Titre Pour Un Album » in English « The Best Title For An Album » as its name indicates it, has the best title an album can get. Mézigue reveals his second album two years after « Votez Mézigue ». An electronic dive in the universe of the faceless man.
House, Techno, Acid, Drum&Bass, Downtempo & more are what you'll meet on the album, influenced by the most bizarre ideas Mézigue bring a new stone to the building.

Lyrics:




(feat. Mr. Fantastik)

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
Yo..

[MF Doom: Talking]
Yo

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
MF Doom

[MF Doom: Talking]
Mr. Fantastik

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
Mr. Fantastik

[MF Doom: Talking]
The villain

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
What up, nigga?

[MF Doom: Talking]
Ain't nuttin, what's the word?

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
What's cracking, boy?

[MF Doom: Talking]
Same ol' shit, kid

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
Man..rap snitches man..shit is bugged out, man, the fuck man

[MF Doom: Talking]
You telling me

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
Niggaz running their mouth, telling anything, anything!

[Chorus x2: Mr. Fantastik]
Rap snitches, tellin all their business
Sit in the court and be they own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator, yeah I'm right here
Fuck around and get the whole label sent up for years (Huh)

[Mr. Fantastik]
Type profile low, like ay get paid in full
Attract heavy cash cuz the game's centrifical
Mister Fantastik long though like elastic
Got my life between glocks, it's made out of plastic
Can't stand the brown nosin nigga fake ass bastard
Admiring my style so I bust through Manhattan
Since plottin, plan the quickest, my flow is the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro.. the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggaz come get me cuz they know I ride
Two to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like a old accordian
Accordin ta him, when the deed's rushed in
Complication from the wild testimony was thin
Caused his man ta go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Blame rap snitch nigga, even told on the mexican
[Chorus x2: Mr. Fantastik] [The second time the chorus is repeated, it doesn't end with ""Huh""]
Rap snitches, tellin all their business
Sit in the court and be they own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator, yeah i'm right here
Fuck around get the whole label sent up for years (Huh)

[MF Doom]
True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah yeah tell 'em tell it on the mountain hill
Runnin up they mouth bill, everybody doubtin still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through the bubble vest or double breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you woulda thought it was the middle east
A little grease always keeps the wheels a spinnin
Like sittin on twenty threes to get the squeelers grinnin
Hittin on many trees, feel real linen
Spittin on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap
(Pat!) son shut your trap, save it for the bitches
MMM...delicious, rap snitch knishes

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
You know what I'm saying? It's a terrible-crazy, man
Just analyzing this all game, it's bugged out
Niggaz snitching..telling on them allselves

[MF Doom: Talking]
It's a horror, man..

[Mr. Fantastik: Talking]
Fuck around..and get anybody bagged, man..
Fuck around and get yo mama bagged, nigga..
You know your grandmama begging..fake hustling nigga

""The Period Works Series has been a fantastic opportunity to explore of my biggest personal influences in dance music ranging from the rich instrumentation of Disco, to the raw energy of early house music. After starting of with Acapellas from the Z Records Library for inspiration in 2016, the series has now culminated into new and original songs influenced by a golden age passed. Thank you to David Lee and Z Records for the opportunity and creative direction, and thank you to everyone who has purchased, listened and danced to the Period Works Series.""

Here comes the second Toy Tonics EP by Joel Holmes & Cody Currie. 

The new Berlin based duo that works on a fresh musical style that combines Jazz, broken beats, Soul and NY House.
Joel, the American jazz pianist, is a former member of Roy Hargrove’s Grammy winning Jazz-Hop band and member of Carl Craig’s synthesizer ensemble. Joel is living in Berlin now, where he is involved in the new vibrant Neo-Jazz scene. (Yes! Berlin used to be a Techno city, but it’s becoming a Jazz town now!)

In Berlin Joel throws monthly jam sessions (the Urban Base Jam) where the creme de la creme of Berlins ex-pad jazz musicians meets up. Crazy things can happen here. Like when Erykah Badu played Berlin in 2019 and her complete band came to jam at Joel’s session after their gig.

Joel teamed up with Cody Currie: 24 year old London born talent, who already made waves in the house scene. Cody is known as a stylized producer, with a unique recognisable sound. Much of his craft was homed in studying a bachelors in music in London. His most known work by now might be a jazzy reinvention of ‘Devils Shoestring’ with over half a million plays on SC and YT. With his new works Cody is coming away from sampling, working only with live instrumentation.

Joel & Cody both live in Berlin now where they met Toy Tonics head honcho Mathias „Kapote“ Modica. And when they met there was a vibe instantly. All three have their roots in jazz music and share similar ideas about how dance-music should evolve in 2020.

Notes
Believed to be second pressing of Unit 1 - Modular Expansion. This record was repressed with the track ""Tension Dream"" instead of ""Hip In The House"". This was probably due to author rights problems because of the use of vocal samples from Ya Kid K in Hi Tek 3 - Spin That Wheel in the ""Hip In The House"" track.

Round three of JARC’s audacious, aural onslaught comes in the for of a double header of incendiary cuts, reworking that disco sound with hypnotic grooves and beefed up low ends, best served at full blast.

First up, you’re hit with ‘Move On Up’, looped, echoed and powered out into the cosmos. Earworm synth and sax hooks meet choice vocal snippets and a pumping beat.

Flip it over for a salacious number, ‘U Make Me Hot’ drenched in horns, guitar struts, and all too enticing vocals, tied together with a boisterous bassline that will rumble the very ground you stand on.

Written and produced by John Lopez. Horn session Guest Art Davis. Recorded at Tonic Recordings Chicago. Mastered at Loud. Barking Music ASCAP.
(C) & (P) 2002 Om Records.
Chicago-born Juan Lopez grew up in the predominately Hispanic Pilsen neighborhood where he was influenced by music at an early age. Soon after his high school years, he traded playing guitar in rock and funk bands for home studio technology that allowed him the freedom to produce his own music without the confines and frustrations that playing in a band presented. Around this time Johnny began his career as a DJ at some of the first underground ""house"" parties in Chicago, and in '88 he landed a residency at Smart Bar with Mark Farina. Three years later he turned a potentially devastating incident into a source of motivation to focus on his career as a producer and began to record for Moonshine, Radikal Fear and the world-renowned Cajual Records. He has produced a number of Billboard hits, remixed the likes of Justin Timberlake, Gloria Estefan, KD Lang and Donna Blakely (just to name a few), and has released records on just about every house label worth listening to. His outstanding musical accomplishments have attracted worldwide attention to this humble artist and his ongoing musical endeavors continue to play a major role in defining the past, present and future of house music."

""Malin Genie's purple patch continues to yield more delights with this latest drop on his self-titled label. This time around the prolific Dutch artist is delving into smoky, hidden corners of house music where dub lingers thick in the air and rough textures scuff depth and character into the synth work. ""Aventijn"" has a purposeful drum machine tick but its utterly somnambulant in its execution, while ""KIAR"" lilts on a dusty groove and woozy clouds of funk. ""Duppy"" has a distinct dub techno influence, but it's still a steadfast house groover at heart, and ""Amulius Numitor"" ditches the beats for a pure interstellar exploration. With some bonus locked grooves for creative DJs, this is a versatile and imaginatively rendered EP with creative spark to match its usefulness in the mix."" -Juno review

A little present for you. I made this track 6 years ago in 2011 and came across it today whilst searching through my old files. Never heard by anyone but me. It differs from my current style but feels good to listen to... uplifting, deep, intense, just how I like it. The vocal sample still gives me goosebumps. Enjoy."

JUNGLE GEORGE ON ACID premiered by DELICIEUSE MUSIQUE:
https://soundcloud.com/delicieuse-musique/premiere-romain-fx-dancing-in-hong-kong-exploited

Hong Kong-based, French-born artist Romain FX delivers a killer quartet for Exploited’s milestone 30th ;Shir Khan presents Black Jukebox’ release. With previous releases on labels like Fantastic Voyage, Fauve Records and 44100HZ Social Club and support for his music from DJ Harvey, Black Madonna, Tensnake, Erol Alkan and Red Axes, he comes with some serious pedigree.
‘A Fuego’ invokes the spirit of early Balearic house with its Latino vocal chants, sampled piano chords playing a triumphant progression, trumpet blasts and sweet chime melodies echoing around the soundscape. ‘Western Outlands’ continues the balmy feel with infectious woodblock melody trading blows with rubbery synth bass and euphoric melody aplenty. Close your eyes and you could be in the open-air era of Amnesia dancing to Alfredo. The authentic ‘80s synth refrains and tribal vocal loops combine in powerful fashion and make for another winner.
‘Jungle George’ somehow manages to rock a panpipe riff and old skool MIDI guitar notes without sounding crass — which is probably something to do with the taut electro bass groove and rolling bongo / conga rhythms that surround it. Rainforest recordings add a heady feel amidst the cool melodies. ‘Dancing In Hong Kong’ provides a madcap end to the EP, a cute little ‘80s electro-funk jam where jaunty keys, organ bass and a little city pop vibe rub up against each other.

Review by JUNO:
""While there's plenty of variety to be found within the Shir Khan-curated Black Jukebox series, you can always rely on the showcased material being club-ready unashamedly party-starting in nature. That's certainly the case with the 30th volume in the series, which sees Romain FX giddily charge between revivalist old-school house cheeriness (the late '80s style Latin house rush of ""A Fuego"", which lifts tribal-influenced scat style vocals from a familiar favourite), post-freestyle NYC/Miami business (the Latin Rascals-go-house flex of ""Western Outlands""), clanking Euro-dance-meets-acid sleaziness (""Jungle Goerge Goes Acid"") and jaunty, smile-inducing proto-piano house giddiness (wonderfully cheerful closing cut ""Dancing In Hong Kong""). Music that will make you want to throw your hands in the air (like you just don't care).""

Following in the footsteps of Outplay’s offshoot 24 Carrot’s number one iteration published last year, Fouk & Junktion are back with the second volume in their carotenoid-rich series - again soberly titled, ’24 Carrot #2’. Known for their juicy blends of low-slung house and tribal funk, the Dutch duo take an outright peppy shot at the news threads’ continuous doom-and gloom with four delectably carefree cuts that’ll boost your lockdown arses to proper upward feelings.

Title: The Unfinished Fight Against Humanity
Label: SNTS
Catalogue: SNTS015LP
Format: 12"" Vinyl
Genre: Electronic
Style: #Techno
Release date: 11th December 2020

Tracklist:
A1:    An Era Of Absurdity
A2:    Bacchanalia
A3:    Temporary Pleasure
B1:    Defence Mechanisms
B2:    Repressive Society
C1:    Ego Death
C2:    Power In History
D1:    Judged By Uncertainty
D2:    Empathy Over Indifference
D3:    Hopeless

""The Unfinished Fight Against Humanity"" is SNTS' third full-length album following ""The Rustling Of The Leaves"" in 2015 and ""Losing Sight"" in 2016.

Ten tracks that are born from the combination of historical, mystical and current references, which lead to a reflection of how the human being can complicate its existence due to behaviour and the consequences that derive from such actions. The dark, hard and energetic rhythms of the album narrate the coexistence of diverse human values throughout history, from peace to war, from love to hate, from empathy to ego.

In words of the artist SNTS, ""the human being has been created to live in society, the problem arises when society fails to coexist or compete to survive"".

New York native Shawn O’Sullivan returns to Avian as 400PPM with debut LP, ‘Fit for Purpose’. 

As an artist, O’Sullivan has long since explored the juncture between hard-hitting, functional dance floor material and more lofty, conceptual work. From a purely structural standpoint, the artist’s return to Avian bears all the hallmarks of previous output under the alias, utilising the same palette found on early EP’s for Guy Brewer’s label. Stripped back and driven, the music marries caustic drum-machine polyrhythms with warping, pitch bent leads and characteristically atmospheric use of reverb. It’s a decidedly dance floor offering, but the music comes refracted through O’Sullivan’s own lens, with plenty of elegant references to a career spent exploring much of the Techno genre’s periphery, from Noise to New Wave. Crushed vox bubble up from beneath wrought-iron percussion and the artist takes time to step away from high energy 4x4 workouts to explore more complex rhythmic structures and harsh, low tempo grooves. 

Whilst O’Sullivan might be quick to shrug off the intellectualisation of his own output, in many ways ‘Fit For Purpose’ and the corresponding imagery work to create a space for the listener to ponder the role of Techno as a genre - its historical relevance both at its genesis and in contemporary society. It is by no means a nostalgic record - at least in explicit compositional terms, rather one that works to capture the sense of unease and hysteria that fuelled, and continues to fuel the vital countercultural movements that have shaped club culture. The LP artwork and sleeve notes feature photographs taken from Ernie Glam’s extraordinary chronicle ‘Fabulosity’. The photo book, featuring images taken by Alexis Dibasio documents the wildly flamboyant club scene that ruled New York in the late 80’s and early 90’s, centred around The Roxy, Love Machine and most famously, The Limelight. 

While O’Sullivan’s music as 400PPM might eschew the colour and vibrance of some of the unabashed hedonists that made up the Club Kids scene - who reinvented the DIY spirit of punk rock and incorporated Sci-Fi and the circus, there is on the one hand an undeniable sense of both the rising hysteria that comes with the pervasive and unbridled drug use for which the group were as infamous as their outfits and rejection of then societal norms, and on the other, a further anxiety regarding the notion of machine-made music in a contemporary society swiftly approaching a new and daunting technological age. 

Of Dibasio’s images, O’Sullivan notes that, ‘... they capture that turning point from reverie to terror, a cherished moment...,’ it’s certainly an emotional shift most people will understand, and an atmosphere that courses through the record, which stands to bear as a collection of some of the artists finest work.

Release Text:
Following on from Fresh Take's recent VA is previous collaborator Bernardo Mota. His standout track on their first release Only the D found its way into the bag of none other than house heavyweight Jamie Jones. Given this and Bernardo’s talent, they thought it was time to let him express himself on his very own EP. 
The title track features a steady groove and spoken word sample which is a stalwart in Mota's productions. Next up is Break down, driven by a wonky acid bassline over a catchy vocal hook and his signature 90s keys. The Always the Same EP drops on Fresh Take May 22nd.

LYRICS

I’m so into you, but I don’t know where I’ve been(Ooh) 
I just want you to, to take me where your heart is

And you're made wonderful
I would never want you to feel like you could never be right 
Love is all you want, I would never do you wrong
Hold it down and give me some time

I’m so into you, but I don’t know where I’ve been (Ooh) 
I just want you to, to take me where your heart is (Ooh) 
(Repeat 2x)

I’m so into you
(Ooh, ooh, you don’t know)
If I wanted to show you
(Backing adlibs)
Just take me where your heart is
(I just want you to, to take me where your heart is) 
(Aahhhh)

I’m so into you, but I don’t know where I’ve been (Ooh) 
I just want you to, to take me where your heart is

https://toytonics.bandcamp.com/album/illegal-jazz-vol-3

Previews: https://soundcloud.com/delfonic/sets/illegal-jazz-vol-3-toye003

Illegal Jazz is a limited edition vinyl Edit series of former OYE records music impresario & king of Berlin’s vinyl diggers DELFONIC and Toy Tonics records boss, DJ, vinyl collector and music nerd KAPOTE. 

Both have a heavy passion for danceable jazz tunes and a massive collection of rare vinyl, so they decided to start this irregular series of edits called ILLEGAL JAZZ where they rework 60ies and 70ies Jazz tunes in a way that they are playable for today's advanced DJs.

Part 1 and 2 have been sold out immediately and played by many DJs from Honey Dijon and Jazzanova to UK Radio DJs like Gilles Peterson, Sarah Evans or Tina Edwards. Virgil Abloh also already featured some of the tracks. So it makes sense to go on and this is part 3.

Lorenz Rhode | Sandpaper EP ft. Jamie Lidell | Dirt Crew Recordings

Cat No. : DIRT129
Release : 04.12.2020

Track list:
A1 Sandpaper ft. Jamie Lidell 
A2 On the Nightshift
B1 Sandpaper ft. Jamie Lidell (Sound Support Remix) 
B2 Sandpaper ft. Jamie Lidell (Instrumental Mix)

Info:
We are very pleased to finally present you a new Lorenz Rhode release, for the „Sandpaper EP“ Lorenz Rhode and Jamie Lidell get together again. Their first collab „Any Kind of Pressure“ was followed by Lorenz joining Jamie’s world tour and a remix of „Big Love“ for Warp Records. Jamie performs with an amazing energy, and his soulful voice is carried by a warm and playful house backing: Minimoog bass, Rhodes piano and just some sparkles of a very old Roland synth that Lorenz had just bought, and which is now broken.

The second new jam „On the Nightshift“ is a fun stabby tune based on a spiraling chord progression. It loops every three-and-a-half bars, just to make life harder for DJs. A real nice warm groover.

The remix for „Sandpaper“ is a true family affair! Sound Support is the all new project by Lars Dales better known as 1/2 of Detroit Swindle and Lorenz himself. They’ve just released their debut EP on Prins Thomas’ “Internasjonal” label in October this year, here they take Jamie’s vocal into a more dramatic and electronic territory touching electro grounds. To close things out we also added an instrumental on the vinyl and radio mix on the digital version of this new EP. Enjoy as much as we did putting this together for you!"

'We Magnify His Name' is a big, belting Gospel House joint, while 'Baby, Baby' works a more classic Hood template, with the exception of some well placed James Brown stabs, and 'Basic Principle' tucks into moodier, organ-driven Techno style.

""Rhythm Is Rhythm"" is produced by ""Mayday"" & Michael James. Behind the pseudonym ""Mayday"" stands one of the most influential producers regarding modern electronic dance music. It´s Derrick May, who is known for inventing the so called ""Detroit Techno"" beside Juan Atkins, Eddie Flashing Fowkles, Kevin Saunderson....

The track is without any doubt a classic. But kind of special to ""Strings Of Life "" is definitely that it is known as a classic in the house  and as well  in the techno scene"

rugciVJX3RA,LUZ1E - Electronic Warefare,309,4575,hurfyd,hurfyd,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzeR0_RWnpNHe6y4DTLwE5Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rugciVJX3RA,"https://voitax.bandcamp.com/album/radical-optimism

If we could describe LUZ1E’s music with one word, it would certainly be »eclectic«. Having drawn influence from her brother’s collection of Chicago and New York House, the Frankfurt-born producer has learnt to manifest her learnings into a fresh take on the seminal sound. Following her success on labels such as Lobster Theremin, Shall Not Fade, Goddess Music, we are very excited to present her four track EP for VOITAX - Radical Optimism.

The opener »Transition« lays down LUZ1E’s law, featuring headstrong drum work, matched with equally menacing bass arpeggios. If the theme of apocalypticism wasn’t obvious enough from the opening track’s looming pads, it will become apparent with Electronic Warfare. Served up on electro’s trustworthy chassis, we watch the distorted arpeggios unfold as the tension of the pads guide us to an dystopian finale. On the flip, the title track »Radical Optimism« uses shrill pad pressure to break the track’s dreamy opening sequence - as the modulating bass provides plenty of frequencies for the dance floor. The closing track, »Emotional Intelligence« provides a candid looking glass into the producer’s musical influences. LUZ1E’s knack for emotive pads furnish the track’s uplifting structure with class, as breaks and bass deliver us to a tender climax."

Lyrics:
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

For its first appearance on the label, Around7, the Parisian rising star and cofounder of OndulÈ Recordings, 
delivers a massive 3 tracks EP and invites his brother from an other mother Phil Weeks (the Robsoul Recordings's Boss) for a heavy dub remix!

Gallic groove meister Sebastien Guertau (Around7) began his musical quest by playing bass in a jazz-funk ensemble.
Eventually he learned to fuse electronics with live instrumentation and boom! 
His new label (with Joss Moog & Jean Ce) Ondule was born. 
Le Bel Age translates as 'the best years' and clearly he's talking about where he's at right now - there's three of his best tunes here - the beguiling jazzy shuffle of the title track, 
remixed into some cool after hours house by Phil Weeks, echoed in the deep house undulations of ""Nuit Blanche"" 
and the abstract piano-meets-beats jam, ""Grasse Mat"". 

--------------------------

Founded in 2014 by Joss moog, Around7 (also producers for Robsoul Recordings) & House lover Jean Cé (aka SFD), the new Parisian label, Ondulé Recordings,  wants to offer a quality sound attached to the roots of house music. 
Deeply inspired by disco, funk, soul/jazz & hip hop, Ondulé will offer a wide range of electronic music to listen to from the couch to the dancefloor, having always one word in mind: GROOVE!!   
We could say deep house, jacking house, nu disco, down tempo… but it doesn't matter after all, Ondulé Recordings has to be a shelter for freedom in music. 
As the name of the label indicates (""Ondulé"" stands for ""Wavy"" in English), what we think today might not be what we'll think tomorrow: Ondulé's music  needs to make you undulate.

Taken from ""Lamaj's Secret"" EP | Out 29.06.2015

Tracklist: 
A1 Lamaj (Original Mix) 
A2 Lamaj (Andy Hart Remix) 
B1 Four Lights 
B2 Garlic Fist Pump 

We first introduced these strapping young house aficionados from Sligo, Ireland, with their debut EP as a pair, “Street Urchin”, a little over a year ago. Since then the guys have been busy with a massive release on Detroit Swindle’s label Heist, not to mention their unbridled musical passion lead them to launch their own label Splendor & Squalor beginning of this year, kicking things off with a sell out vinyl only pressing of another four track EP of their own imaginings featuring a hot remix from Session Victim. 

We’re pleased to share with you their latest creation, the stunning “Lamaj’s Secret EP”. Now, we’re not sure who Lamaj is exactly, but the mystery, funk and raw sex appeal in these four jams certainly has us wondering. 

First up we meet “Lamaj”, this track drips with delicate melodic samples, jazz tainted drums and bass driven funk galore. We asked our long time friend, Australian Andy Hart, to give it a flip for us on A2. He opened things up, deepened the vibe and brought some bass toms to deliver a final punch. The B-side begins with “Four Lights”, here the guys slow things down a little and remind us of their gift for nostalgia touched soul and groove samples. Finally, “Garlic Fist Pump”, as the name suggests, takes us straight back out to the dance floor, between the dynamic live drums, subtle vocal snips cry to the hip hop Brame & Hamo draw so much inspiration from. 

Welcome to the House of Lamaj, we hope you’ll take off your coat and stay a while."

Umwelt returns to his own New Flesh Records imprint with his unique EP to date this year. ""Escape The Future"" sees the French producer concluding his Future trilogy started in 2015 with ""When Future And Past Collapse"" and pursued in 2017 with ""Encoding The Future"" on Netherlands based Shipwrec. Fuelled by industrial and post-apocalyptic atmospheres, Umwelt's brand new 12"" gathers together all of the elements that made his dark sound so recognizable, a digest of complex yet dancefloor rhythms fused into insane synth oscillations and Rave influences.
Melodic ""Escape The Future"" is a much anticipating five tracker blending Umwelt's unique aesthetic and style, obsessed by a pessimistic vision of the future.

Tracklist:
1. Drugs
2. Quilmes
3. 3XL

FJAAK is a hell of a drug. We know you like some more. 

It was only a matter of time before your favorite Spandau-repping producer trio would grace a release on Seilscheibenpfeiler with their unmistakably powerful productions. 
Following up Solid Blake’s slamming electro excursions on SSPB005, FJAAK put us back into 4/4 territory with two highly addictive techno belters and a sweaty, break-y rave epic. 

FJAAK do what they do best: They draw inspiration and references from various past eras and shape it into something truly now and original. It’s probably not even on purpose, all the history seems to be in their young blood. 

First track „3XL“ instantly starts with a heavy breakbeat and a darkly soaring bassline, bringing in some acid and vocal fragments that carry you back to the early 90s. Their famed hands-on approach to a predominantly hardware set-up is discernible throughout the EP. 
„Quimes“ continues with 135 bmp of straight, queerly melodic and kick drum focused techno, pure and rich at the same time. „Drugs“ is even more stripped down, laying all its force into the drums and repeating its title all over again. You decide whether this is music to take drugs to or rather some kind of sardonic commentary. It certainly gets you high.

Release date: Dec 14, 2018

It’s always good when we hear some local based talent sending in tunes. Next on Fresh Take we have Glasgow based Dan Be who's managed to make filter house feel fresh. Both tracks are peak time groovers espousing notes of Daft Punk through some of his chops. He recently got the nod from Disclosure due to his abstract chords so keep close tabs on this upcomer.

Four years after the conception of Heist Recordings with Break up to make up EP by label heads Detroit Swindle, they deliver their 5th solo record and release #26 for the label. On the 'Can't hold it' EP, the guys showcase their love for lush disco, analogue basslines and leftfield musicians, bringing in NYC native Willie Burns for a remix that shows you the darkest side of Heist yet."

Randstad is the production and DJ moniker of dutch multimedia artist Thomas van Linge, co-founder of the record labels BAKK and Rubber and freshly relocated to Berlin. After first hearing his rhythmic drum workout on ‘Metalloid’, his contribution for this year’s ‘Still Life’ compilation, we’re glad to have tapped his second EP ‘These Serpents’ for Veyl. Randstad is pushing his idea across the spectrum of industrialized beat music for this outright roaring 6-tracker ideal to tear down clubs when they finally re-open in 2036.

All tracks written & produced by Thomas van Linge in London and Berlin between 2018 - 2020. Published by Copyright Control. Mastered by Thomas P. Heckmann, cut by Kitaro Beeh at Schnittstelle in Berlin. Photography by Tomasio Lisca. Executive producers: Alex Knoblauch & Thomas Feriero.

In love with Jazz and everything it gave birth to, Paul Cut seeks to maintain a long-standing tradition by merging it with House music. 
Whether by sampling tracks in the studio or playing the keyboards on stage, his sole purpose is the Groove.
Paul Cut, a young Parisian productor, is delighted to make his first release with OndulÈ Recordings, presenting ""The Joy"", 
a nuanced EP of three tracks which hints at more collaborations with Joss Moog and Around7 in the next few months.

The crew behind Parisian label, Ondule, Joss Moog, Around7 and Jean Ce, state that the label is not simply about being deep house, jacking house or nu-disco. 
No sireee, it's simply about one thing - the groove. Nothing could be truer than with Paul Cut's latest, The Joy, 
offering three thrilling throbbers - the live bass guitar-led, techy disco title track, 
the off-kilter warped house of ""The World"" and the deep, warm and touchy-feely jazz-house embers of ""Glow"".

---------------------------------------
[Hook] 
Get yo' hands; 
Up against the wall and spread them 
Opposition, I can't stand them 
Fuck you (Fuck you) 
Fuck you (Fuck you) 
Un-da-stand; 
I'm not fuckin around with you 
Try to resist I'll dimiss you 
Fuck you (Fuck you) 
Fuck you (Fuck you) 

[Verse 1] 
Basically I'm the worst nightmare you ever had 
Huh, figure but trigger happy nigga with a badge 
Parading around Los Angeles 
High off coke with a banana clip 
Feasting off the weak street avangelists 
With a manuscript, and a proffesional ass-whippin 
Task force, brass knuckles, a master in ass-kickin 
If ya ask for it, I blast for it, your back flippin 
No one saw it, I won't stop the clock's tickin 
Got a rookie for a partner that's ready to fight niggas 
The world's a merry-go-round of stereotype niggas 
He's a spit in the face for pitbull or bite niggas 
Matter-a fact, kinda like this cat for a white nigga 

[Hook] 

[Verse 2] 
I got the projects on lock; they trust my logic 
Cuz the star cops got it from guns to narcotics 
My object is to deprogram, blind your optics 
You cannot stop this mission, this topic 
Cuz you could write tickets my nigga or get paid 
Learn this game of the streets or get slayed 
Collect this cheese at the end of this maze 
Or hit the desk and fill out forms for days 
Need I remind you - how easy it would be, 
To take the city by storm, with a whole force behind you 
Shottie in the trunk and on my ankle there's a nine too 
Cuz psychologically the guns you use, will define you 

[Hook] 

[Verse 3] 
These evil streets don't sleep, be careful of whom you mingle 
In a city where it pays to be bilingual 
Cho soy greifo, no me porta bu culro (si) via ah diablo 
Or five-o, leavin enemies dead on arrival 
For a couple of mil', and your fuckin the deal up 
Try to play hero cop and you still suck 
Put you to bed, or runnin your head, you won't feel much 

[Hook 2x]"

↓ LYRICS ↓

So many times we rise and fall
After awhile it's good and all together
Together
So many times we rise and fall
Wondering if we'll find it all together
Together

Baby, but all the nights and days we spent together
(Together)
It's so easy to forget how to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

So many times we rise and fall
After awhile it's good and all together
Together
So many ways to lose it all
Livin' with future, we won't have to give up
Together

Baby, but all the nights and days we spent together
Together
It's so easy to forget how to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

But nothing's ever stopped
Take us to the top
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories"

Released - 7th November 2020
BUY FROM - https://editorialrecords1200.bandcamp.com/album/palafico-honey-bigger-dreaming

Palafico Honey are back with a second EP under their new alias on Editorial Records. 
Bigger Dreaming is a house driven, nu-disco ode which calls back to their first releases as Cappa & Daniel-San, full of their typical funk guitar stabs, swinging basslines and soaring vocal harmonies. 
The four-piece honed the track over two years, split between the studio and the stage, where they enhance their live instrumentation with pads and turntables to add fuel to the fire.
 Two mixes from label mates stretch the band’s idea to the fullest. Editorial boss, Dave Allison, steps up on remix duties to deliver a lower tempo jam, driven by a silky synth bass, while Funk District provides the third mix, a bustling house jam full of Mexican flare.

B1 – Uncle Buck (Brame & Hamo Remix)
B2 – Neck of the Woods

Digi Only - Sundays


Release Info: 

Always on the scout for the freshest talent, Dirt Crew Recordings breaks into 2016 bringing together a couple of our more recent discoveries, Loz Goddard & Harry Wolfman for their all new ’Square Lane’ EP. Relative newcomer, from Manchester and London respectively, the pair in fact debuted on our label in 2015, on independent tracks ‘The Schrew’ from Harry as a collaboration with Laurence Guy, and Loz’s solo jam ‘That Same Thing’.

Straight up vibes on the groove stricken ‘Uncle Buck’, a no questions asked dance floor weapon and a testament to Loz & Harry’s ability to bring together the finest samples, synths, live percussive elements and a whole lot of soul. ’Problem Child’, gets a bit sleazier, vocal cuts and swirling keys ease us into a broken beat throw down in the break before thrusting us back to the mercy of the straight up four to the floor swing.

On the flip resident Dirt Crew Recordings producers and all round top blokes Brame & Hamo came to the table with a funked out version of ’Uncle Buck’, enlisting Brame’s brother to jam out the smooth stepping live bass for the remix.

Rounding out the pressing ’Neck of the Woods’ has a blissed out melodic quality, coasting along with a sunny energy and and just the right amount of cowbell, while the digital only offering, ‘Sundays’ is soulful and shaking in the deepest sense, those bass licks and key riffs definitely give us the feel of this very special day of the week.

Uniting on this EP Loz Goddard & Harry Wolfman are a sign of things to come in for Dirt Crew Recordings. We have a lot of huge plans in store for the year ahead already and look forward to a massive 2016 filled with music."

Continuing the Fresh Take / Antwerp connection we've enlisted the services of petitMaurice to take us into the winter months. Midnight Theme has been a secret weapon of a number of DJs through the summer and it's now finally landing. A classic, funky, builder which can change the pace of any set. Its partner, Dreamy Scapes, is a spacious ambient journey through gentle acid and luscious synth pads. A well rounded debut outing.

Are you ready for a return to the past? To celebrate its 3rd anniversary and after the successes of its previous compilations “Habemus Paname”, Pont Neuf Records offers a jump in time with “3615 Disco”. Curated by Madcat, one of the spearheads of the Paris label, this new compilation sounds like a cry of love, a tribute to the French disco/boogie of the 80s revisited by those who are the faces of the new French house scene.

“Road: a wide way leading from one place to another.” Roads are where humans have fulfilled the purpose of their existence. As the monk follows God’s road, the merchant follows the road to wealth, and the artist that to inspiration. We, Mind Travellers, walk the Road to Nowhere. Techno is our journey. Enjoy the trip, Kas:st.

Saturday Night Rush make their Lobster Theremin debut with a heavy and unique four-tracker of sub-heavy breakbeat and deep house, following up their acclaimed 2019 ‘Open’ EP for There Is Love In You.

‘Relief’ EP draws influence on a spectrum of classic house sounds along with a ton of UK influence, with bass-driven breaks meeting rave ready piano stabs, garage drums, and luscious deep synth patterns all colliding on one killer 12”. Title track ‘Relief’ is full bassline wobble riding under ravey breakbeat house; Unite is ethereal, classic house music from the dreamworld of deep house past; ‘Wicked Dub’ rides the proto-garage vibes across an off-kilter UK house template; lastly, ‘Real Headz’ is proper house music flavours. Steeped in Detroit and New York influence with a hefty dose of London for good measure. A suitably classic closer to the EP.

This release is a glimpse into the pallet or one of London’s most exciting new producers and paves the way for an exciting run of future projects with the Lobster Theremin label set to drop in 2021."

Yan Cook - Wide Angle EP - Soma 515d

Dynamic Ukrainian producer Yan Cook makes his debut on Soma Records with the Wide Angle EP. Active on the scene for some time now and releasing on a number of top flight labels, Yan delivers a devastating 4 track EP, chalked full of his distinctive sound. 

The ominous title Wide Angle kicks things off with thumping and tripped out low end and doesn’t hold back, firing straight out of the block with rapid percussion and twisted synth elements. Krater keeps up the pace with a more rolling and hypnotic feel; crushing rhythmic elements has Yan on full attack mode with this track. Blacklisted keeps up the aggressive vibes with sinister tones, growling basslines and yet more jarring and propulsive rhythms. Closing out with Red Stream, Yan continues with the malevolent vibes as dark and forbidding tones permeate throughout this perfectly crafted tool.

Yan Cook is yet another welcome addition to the ever growing roster of high quality talent on Soma."

B2:    Alan Oldham - We Need Our Weave

Stamped Whitelabel ADE

Welcome Back Devil by Shlømo opens the second EP UFOx02 with forward beats and euphoric Rave-Stabs. The Berlin producer Alien Rain then goes into a compelling Acid dialogue with his Tribute 2 - minimalist, hyp- notic, pumping. The Parisian Maxime Iko turns on the energy level on his track In Utero with alienated vocals, powerful beats and encouraging Acidlines. And finally Detroit Technos Rennaissance Man Alan Oldham closes UFOx02 with the haunting vocal Techno number We Need Our Weave (Remix).

Love Dancing, along with Jesse Proudfoot and Chris Allen’s Good Faith, was a formative dance experience for many of us in Vancouver and an essential ingredient in the Mood Hut stew. The music on this disc dates from that period and captures some of the energy of the Love Dancing parties. We hope you enjoy it.

Producer & DJ Mall Grab has announced his new EP ‘How The Dogs Chill, Vol. 1’, on his brand new imprint ‘Looking For Trouble.’  

The new release arrives ahead of Mall Grab’s upcoming ‘Looking For Trouble' tour, including a London headline show on 6th October at E1.

The 25 year old’s latest record follows one of last summer’s biggest house releases - 'Pool Party Music’ on DJ Haus’s ever-excellent Hot Haus Recs, as well as a collaborative EP earlier this year alongside Loods on Steel City Dance Discs, the label he runs with his friends Jarred Kennedy and Jackson Fitzsimmons. Having emerged in 2015 with the infectious ‘Feel U’ EP, the strength and evolution of Jordon’s productions has firmly established him as one of dance music’s most exciting talents.

The new EP arrives in the middle of another busy period for Mall Grab.  Having played well over 100 shows in the last year, he just curated the London event Long Live Southbank - a one off fundraiser party supporting the restoration of Southbank’s hallowed Undercroft skate space, which was streamed by Boiler Room. Having grown up skateboarding the event’s cause was a particularly special one for Jordon. About to embark on his much anticipated ‘Looking For Trouble’ tour throughout September and October and with more shows through November & December in Japan and Australia, Mall Grab will close out 2018 on a high."

Mr. BC is the one in charge of remixing « Babaganush », and he sends off a more playful and energetic piece than the original, whose footprint is reflected in every note and in its capacity to disconnect us from the unnecessary, as we connect with what really matters: music, emotions and what is prophetically vital."

Artist: Alpha Tracks
Title: Contract Labour 
Label: Blue Hour
Catalogue: BLUEHOUR012
Format: 12"" Vinyl
Genre: Electronic
Style: Techno
Release date: May 1, 2019

Tracklist:
A1 Freedive (7:25)
A2 Hyperreality (5:42)
B1 Golden Shot (6:59)
B2 Arise (7:26)

Native Austrian Felix Benedikt will release the four-track EP Contract Labour May 1st on Luke Standing’s Blue Hour Music outlet. Benedikt, who began his musical education under the tutelage of Erdem Tunakan at Cheap Records in Vienna, before moving on to TONGUES in the same city - the store where the Alpha Tracks project first began to take shape courtesy of studio located above the shop, sits neatly within the realm of Blue Hour Music’s aesthetic concerns. Of late, Standing has been developing the label’s roster with a keen ear - refining the sound & building a solid and versatile group of producers & live performers around him. Alpha Tracks, with his largely retro-futuristic, but decidedly fresh approach to high energy proto-Trance makes for a glowing addition to Standing’s stable. The music draws from a well-worn palette but feels wholly zeitgeisty in the current climate - pushed 909 drums provide the backbone of the work, with rich, emotive melodies working in tandem with the heady 303 leads - the accomplished, effective finish on the recordings bearing the hallmarks of a seasoned ear - all making for a fantastically satisfying dance floor package. Regarding his approach to production, Benedikt is keen to state that much of his work relies on improvisation - on an organic, real-time recording process that draws its energy from the actual physicality and technical limitations associated with working predominantly with analog hardware. No doubt this is where the magic comes from on Contract Labour, a centred and powerful addition to the Blue Hour Music discography.

https://www.deejay.de/Anetha_Sugar_ABSL_Dont_Rush_To_Grow_Up_MTY001_Vinyl__936714

Artist: Anetha, Sugar, Absl
Title: Don't Rush To Grow Up
Label: Mama Told Ya
Catalogue: MTY001
Format: 12"" Vinyl, Digital
Genre: Electronic
Style: Techno
Release date: 11 October 2019

Tracklist:
A1:    ABSL - Et Le Soleil Ne Vint Pas
A2:    ABSL & Anetha - Elles
B1:    Sugar - Vapouring Sun
B2:    Sugar & Anetha - Candy From Strangers

For the first release, Anetha is inviting the talented Sugar from Fast Forward Productions based in Copenhagen, and her good friend ABSL from Paris.

MTY 001 features two original tracks produced by Sugar and ABSL themselves, and two other ones co-produced with Anetha. More than just “club ready” productions, every track is built like a story that you can also enjoy peacefully at home. Each piece is long enough to allow you to go through different states of feeling, atmospheres, and even be surprised by the evolution and new elements of the tracks. In the A1 « Et le soleil ne vint pas » by ABSL, a tension is created and evolves for several minutes with a sustained and crunchy rhythm that keeps the listener in suspense. Later, the emergence of a dazzling and sparkling melody come to break this infernal cadence and give some space and light. In the end, darkness definitely takes over to crush the last ray of sunshine. ABSL & Anetha blends hypnotic moment and percussive techno drums in the A2 called “Elles”. The heady and repetitive voice plays a leading role between the different parts and finally gives way to let smooth and evocative synths appear. Minds and bodies can feel soothed and enveloped by the softness of the sounds… A perfect way to finish a set. During Sugar’s B1 « Vapouring sun », you can experience at the first notes that something epic and intense awaits you. The track is built with a deep rhythm, some shamanic breathing and outrageous chord progression that make the track feel engineered for special moments only. Please, make sure this is the right time and place to play it! Last but not least, B2 « Candy from strangers » track is a fresh and colourful collaborative track by Sugar & Anetha in which many layers reflect the personalities of the two producers. Sometimes techno, with striking synthesizers and energetic drums, but also trancy with an evolving and singular melody. Very fun and pleasant to play – you’ll see :) The collaborative spirit reflects and animates the graphic part of the label as well. In order to inaugurate the first cover, Anetha invited the talented Helin Sahin who produced a magnificent futuristic piece of art. A precious and organic image that plays with perspective, space and matter.

For the graphic identity, Mama told ya partnered with the great Diplomatie Studio team based in Paris.

Denmark’s Niles Cooper is someone who has been increasing his profile over the last couple of years. The “juuc” connoisseur has gained notoriety for some of his edits, reworks and sample-based originals on both Soundcloud and Youtube, so it’s surprising that his first pressed 12” only came to fruition this past May. Since then, a few other records have hit shops in quick succession, stocking shelves with his freshly squeezed offerings that range from pulp-filled stompers to tastefully flavored miksed smoothies. Obviously, it was only a matter of time before Mr. Cooper would grace the pages of Bolting Bits with one of his stellar records - and that day is today!

Shedding a bit of his familiar thumping flare for a more relaxed approach, Niles has decided to team up with Melbourne’s Kyoku Records to pen an EP entitled The Juuc Miks that is as breezy and carefree as their other releases from Ethyene, Dorsi Plantar, Long Island Sound, and Sune. On the record, Niles has chosen to feature 3 brand-new originals and a remix from Bolting Bits favorite Joe Corti!

We were lucky enough to get our hands on Joe's remix of ""Strygere & Klaver,"" and are happy to report that it's a certified banger! What's remarkable about the tune is how little it resembles the original. I've listened to both versions several times already, and I'm still struggling to find where the two overlap. However, this should not be interpreted as some sort of bad thing. In fact, Joe's remix provides a great deal of balance to the record as a whole, giving listeners a little taste of the dancefloor in between their courses of Niles' unwinding, disco soiree. Although palate cleansers are usually not known for their strong tastes, the combination of Joe's punching house and Niles' tranquil melodies create a taste that’s enriched to maximum umami!

To get your hands on this remix as well as Niles' 3 originals, make sure to pre-order your copy! The Juuc Miks is set to come out on January 28th!"

The Fresh Take - Paris connection continues with two versatile house beats, this time courtesy of Jakob Apelian. The title track is an infectious groover that you'll struggle not to cut a shape too. Contrastingly, the flip side is a more introspective cut, with a shimmering vox sample driving the tune. Perfect for those still clinging onto summer!

Our next part of the TT Bandcamp Edit series was made by two friends from the island of Ischia. Next to Napoli. BPlan & Fab_o make edits from rare but amazing songs from the 1970ies Italian Disco scene. B sides and forgotten tracks, with little reworks, beat adjustment and arrangement effort. Three pearls from the Italo world. This is funky stuff. Have fun!

https://www.traxsource.com/title/1414918/discotech

asily one of our favourite artists over at theBasement Discos, West-coast dj & producer Never Dull is back with a superb new EP comprising three tracks; this one is packed from head to toe with the house, disco and funky stuff.

Lead track 'Esta Llama' is a beautifully tasty slice of Latin influenced vibes. It has those crunchy guitar licks and brilliant Hispano vocals; this one is a dancefloor winner all day long. The EP moves gracefully between the smooth disco house and other powerful vibes like the ones brought on 'Push The Freak' and 'Take That'.

The EP packs in with two brilliant pieces of disco-edged boogie house brought to you by French maestro Art Of Tones, a real firm favourite on the scene with a hugely impressive standard on all his productions. From laidback grooves straight to the middle of the dancefloor, DISCOTECH EP has all bases well and truly covered.

Artist: Alpha Tracks
Title: Contract Labour 
Label: Blue Hour
Catalogue: BLUEHOUR012
Format: 12"" Vinyl
Genre: Electronic
Style: Techno
Release date: May 1, 2019

Tracklist:
A1 Freedive (7:25)
A2 Hyperreality (5:42)
B1 Golden Shot (6:59)
B2 Arise (7:26)

Native Austrian Felix Benedikt will release the four-track EP Contract Labour May 1st on Luke Standing’s Blue Hour Music outlet. Benedikt, who began his musical education under the tutelage of Erdem Tunakan at Cheap Records in Vienna, before moving on to TONGUES in the same city - the store where the Alpha Tracks project first began to take shape courtesy of studio located above the shop, sits neatly within the realm of Blue Hour Music’s aesthetic concerns. Of late, Standing has been developing the label’s roster with a keen ear - refining the sound & building a solid and versatile group of producers & live performers around him. Alpha Tracks, with his largely retro-futuristic, but decidedly fresh approach to high energy proto-Trance makes for a glowing addition to Standing’s stable. The music draws from a well-worn palette but feels wholly zeitgeisty in the current climate - pushed 909 drums provide the backbone of the work, with rich, emotive melodies working in tandem with the heady 303 leads - the accomplished, effective finish on the recordings bearing the hallmarks of a seasoned ear - all making for a fantastically satisfying dance floor package. Regarding his approach to production, Benedikt is keen to state that much of his work relies on improvisation - on an organic, real-time recording process that draws its energy from the actual physicality and technical limitations associated with working predominantly with analog hardware. No doubt this is where the magic comes from on Contract Labour, a centred and powerful addition to the Blue Hour Music discography.

In the special occasion of our 10th birthday we felt we had to concoct something really memorable, bringing together in 2 vinyl some of the most influential artists who took part in the making of our history and some new ones, yet prominent and successful, to the family. All of them had a fascinating mission to accomplish honouring the concept of “Jazzy” which is the notion and approach set 10 years ago as the fundament of Apparel Music and we can plainly say that they’ve won the challenge, brightly, producing 8 stunning tracks which represent an ideal declination of the requirements you need to enter the AM family.

Chevals then takes over in C2 with “All I Wanna Do Is Love You” and we’re so happy to see a skilled guy like him being recognised in the music business, as sometimes a label's purpose is just to be the perfect filter of someone else's visions. His track is another tangible example of his qualities.

The highly anticipated project of long-time friends Hans Müller and Wolfgang Schneider bring to you LAZYWAX. Meeting at a discotheque in Berlin, the duo immediately began finding similar interests in their favourite Italia-disco producers and composers. Their instant connection lead to the birth of their first track ‘Pluto’ at Han’s studio on an 8 track tape machine, Minimoog Model-D and a Juno 60.

Since the inception of the LAZYWAX project, the pair have been devoted to the studio where they have been tirelessly working to create an array of quintessential discotheque tracks which draw on elements of modern European disco, whilst still paying homage to disco deities of the seventies and eighties. Although the project has been kept tightly-sealed over the years, the rumours have finally surfaced about a string of live performances set to take place in the near future.

The Silver Rider takes time away from farm-life to drop two heart-tender disco missives, while splitting the slab with Londoner, Bustin' Loose, who makes his Whiskey Disco debut.

Kicking things off on the a-side is The Silver Rider with 'Roundhouse,' a reworking of a stone-cold classic that injects club ready beats and high energy vibes into some very recognizable sample sources. Next up, TSR keeps the energy, but adds a sunkissed breeze to the mix with 'You're The One,' a super smooth and groovy number perfect for top-down cruising or pool side jamming.

Flip it over for a powerful pair of cuts from Bustin' Loose... the founder of London's, The Disco Express party series and a burgeoning producer with previous releases on Toy Tonics and Roux Records. 'These Ol' Days' gets us started with proper warm up tackle as a silky, filtered loop evolves and opens atop funky guitar loops and sultry vocals. Move the needle to the inside cut and we take the energy up a notch with 'Home Way Phase,' who's galloping percussion creates an urgency for shimmering strings and horn stabs to perfectly punctuate... PROPER!

Los Angeleno and all around swell guy Dino Soccio has been building his rep as a premier selector and editor with his own Pleasure of Love edits series, and now joins the RNT ranks with an EP of rarified rework gold.

The record kicks off with the meteoric energy of 'Star Beaming', a rolling interstellar disco stomper, then lays back with the low-slung 'Fred’s Groove' and jazzy balearic groove of 'Laid Back', finishing off with the bouncey early-'80s boogie feel of 'Forgot'. All dusty digger’s delights, simonized and edited to perfection for maximum vibes!

Video by POLYMORPHIAN RESILIENCE.

Composed of two artists, Fibula and Korman, the Polymorphian Resilience project fall into an abstract approach. The procedure is carried out in two stages:The capture of real images, which will then be reworked to create visualpatterns. The aim is to retranscribe the rhythm and atmosphere of the musicfrom motifs and shapes that pre-exist in the environment. The result is directlyaddressed to the senses of the spectator, who will associate the sensationsconveyed by these images with his or her own subjectivity.

Artist: Alpha Tracks
Title: Contract Labour 
Label: Blue Hour
Catalogue: BLUEHOUR012
Format: 12"" Vinyl
Genre: Electronic
Style: Techno
Release date: May 1, 2019

B2 Arise (7:26)

Native Austrian Felix Benedikt will release the four-track EP Contract Labour May 1st on Luke Standing’s Blue Hour Music outlet. Benedikt, who began his musical education under the tutelage of Erdem Tunakan at Cheap Records in Vienna, before moving on to TONGUES in the same city - the store where the Alpha Tracks project first began to take shape courtesy of studio located above the shop, sits neatly within the realm of Blue Hour Music’s aesthetic concerns. Of late, Standing has been developing the label’s roster with a keen ear - refining the sound & building a solid and versatile group of producers & live performers around him. Alpha Tracks, with his largely retro-futuristic, but decidedly fresh approach to high energy proto-Trance makes for a glowing addition to Standing’s stable. The music draws from a well-worn palette but feels wholly zeitgeisty in the current climate - pushed 909 drums provide the backbone of the work, with rich, emotive melodies working in tandem with the heady 303 leads - the accomplished, effective finish on the recordings bearing the hallmarks of a seasoned ear - all making for a fantastically satisfying dance floor package. Regarding his approach to production, Benedikt is keen to state that much of his work relies on improvisation - on an organic, real-time recording process that draws its energy from the actual physicality and technical limitations associated with working predominantly with analog hardware. No doubt this is where the magic comes from on Contract Labour, a centred and powerful addition to the Blue Hour Music discography.

After some releases on several interesting label in the techno scene, Reform make return to Etruria with their strong new ep called 'Checkmate"", which includes two remixes from the Soma talent Charles Fenckler and the Belgian Amelie Lens . First original is a melodic track characterized by hypnotic synths which interchange everytime in the arrangement and also dirty and powered drums. Amelie version's express exactly her style, giving to the tracks something magic with the vocals added, making a very true and enigmatic game of chess. Second original instead is dominated by a strong pad, which fill up the mix, blowing up in the break and giving an epic feeling to the ensemble. Charles's remix is techno with no excuses: raw powerful and groovy, is the perfect end for this pack, giving a much more underground touch to the release.

Artist: Denise Rabe
Title: Outa Body
Label: Black Label Distillery 
Catalogue: BLD003
Format: Digital, 12"" Vinyl
Genre: Electronic
Style: #Techno
Release date: August 3, 2020

Tracklist:
1. Outa Body 
2. Brilliance 
3. Outa Body (Perc Remix) 
4. Brilliance (Svreca Remix) 
5. Fully In (Digital Exclusive) 
6. Spacetrouble (Digital Exclusive)

Denise Rabe has quickly attracted attention with her distinctive approach to techno: powerful percussive force, detailed sound design, and slowly modulating compositions crafted to induce dancefloor hypnosis. Following acclaimed releases on Arts Collective, Stroboscopic Artefacts, and her own Rabe label, Denise joins Blacklabel Distillery with a new 12” that digs deep into the hypnotic dimensions of her sound.

“Brilliance” is a shimmering monolith, serpentine sounds woven through head-nodding beats. “Outa Body” delivers on its promise of transcendence with slowly evolving drones unfolding over a driving rhythm. Perc brings things back down to earth with a relentless remix that conjures images of malfunctioning, mutating machinery, while Sverca freezes “Brilliance” into suspended animation, captivating with just a few layers of sound.

The digital tracks highlight Rabe’s exceptional compositional skills, exploring subtly shifting alien soundscapes on “Spacetrouble” and mesmerizing with the massive cosmic sounds of “Fully In”.

In love with Jazz and everything it gave birth to, Paul Cut seeks to maintain a long-standing tradition by merging it with House music. 
Whether by sampling tracks in the studio or playing the keyboards on stage, his sole purpose is the Groove.
Paul Cut, a young Parisian productor, is delighted to make his first release with OndulÈ Recordings, presenting ""The Joy"", 
a nuanced EP of three tracks which hints at more collaborations with Joss Moog and Around7 in the next few months.

The crew behind Parisian label, Ondule, Joss Moog, Around7 and Jean Ce, state that the label is not simply about being deep house, jacking house or nu-disco. 
No sireee, it's simply about one thing - the groove. Nothing could be truer than with Paul Cut's latest, The Joy, 
offering three thrilling throbbers - the live bass guitar-led, techy disco title track, 
the off-kilter warped house of ""The World"" and the deep, warm and touchy-feely jazz-house embers of ""Glow"". 

--------------------------

Founded in 2014 by Joss moog, Around7 (also producers for Robsoul Recordings) & House lover Jean Cé (aka SFD), the new Parisian label, Ondulé Recordings,  wants to offer a quality sound attached to the roots of house music. 
Deeply inspired by disco, funk, soul/jazz & hip hop, Ondulé will offer a wide range of electronic music to listen to from the couch to the dancefloor, having always one word in mind: GROOVE!!   
We could say deep house, jacking house, nu disco, down tempo… but it doesn't matter after all, Ondulé Recordings has to be a shelter for freedom in music. 
As the name of the label indicates (""Ondulé"" stands for ""Wavy"" in English), what we think today might not be what we'll think tomorrow: Ondulé's music  needs to make you undulate.

tFuujExs03A,Mr Fingers - Can You Feel It,330,4016706,HouseNationChicago,HouseNationChicago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWKcU7T0paC5THKcnb_O4nQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFuujExs03A,"Born on Chicago's south side in 1960, Heard began buying records from an early age, and was influenced by his parents' jazz and gospel collection. Though he practiced on guitar and bass as a youth, he joined a friend's band playing drums after bluffing his way through an audition at the age of 17. Heard began practicing with fervor and became quite good, though he took a civil-service job as well to pay the bills. While playing with a variety of local bands during the late '70s and early '80s (including one with future house star Adonis on bass), Heard was introduced to many different types of synthesizers, and he gradually became more interested in playing keyboards than drums. Heard finally opted out of the band setup in 1984, bought a synthesizer/drum machine combo and began producing music. After a few days with the gear, he had recorded three tracks later recognized as serious pinnacles of Chicago house, among them ""Mystery of Love,"" ""Washing Machine"" and ""Can You Feel It."" His lack of connections in the club scene made it difficult to get the tracks listened to, though Heard finally debuted on wax with a 1985 single for DJ International named ""Donnie."" Instead of being credited to Larry Heard however, the single appeared as the It, and was co-written by street poet Harry Dennis. Later, on one of his infrequent trips into the club/party scene, Heard met up with Robert Owens. Owens was then working as a DJ though he was (more importantly) an incredibly talented gospel-styled vocalist. Heard and Owens decided to form Fingers Inc., with the addition of Ron Wilson.

The nascent Chicago house scene was just about to explode with recording activity, and Heard released nearly a dozen singles during 1986-87, for both Trax and DJ International. Fingers Inc. contributed Chicago classics like ""Mystery of Love,"" ""You're Mine,"" ""Distant Planet"" and ""Bring Down the Walls"" while Mr. Fingers dropped quite possibly the most sublime house single ever released, ""Can You Feel It."" (Though by no means a hard and fast rule, Fingers Inc. releases were usually vocal tracks, while Heard used the tag Mr. Fingers as his solo outlet.)

By the end of the '80s, Heard's name was being dropped by many in the new wave of British producers influenced by American house music. He continued recording in earnest, and released one of the first house full-lengths with the 1988 Fingers Inc. LP Another Side for Jack Trax Records. The following year, Jack Trax released Heard's original 1984 instrumental demos as the Mr. Fingers album Amnesia, even though he had never given consent to the album's issue. Despite its barely legal status, the LP showcased the first flowering of Heard's genius with several impeccable tracks. His large production role on the 1989 debut album by Lil' Louis (of ""French Kiss"" fame) was noticed by the major labels and by the beginning of the 1990s, Heard was being offered contracts by several labels. He recorded additional material with Harry Dennis, though Dennis' continuing drug problems gave Heard a desire to strike out on his own.

After finally signing to MCA as a solo act in 1991, Heard issued his first major-label album one year later. Mr. Fingers' Introduction charted an intriguing balance between floor-filling garage house and several tracks of polished jazz-fusion; Heard's undying influence among DJs and producers alike made the album quite an international success. Though it graced the American dance charts as well, MCA attempted to interfere with the production of its follow-up Back to Love, and later refused to release the album at all. It finally appeared in 1995 on Black Market Records, the label formed by Heard's friend and former manager Ren Galston.

By the time Back to Love was released however, Heard had already recorded and released another album, his first as simply Larry Heard. The album Sceneries Not Songs, Vol. 1 (and its follow-up) both expanded on Heard's commitment to inner space rather than the dancefloor. He returned to a style more tied to traditional house with 1996's Alien and the following year's Dance 2000. In late 1997, Heard suddenly declared that he had quit recording to take a computer-programming job in Memphis. Despite his seeming retirement from music, two more albums of new tracks filtered out in 1998. Yet another, Genesis, followed in 1999. For the 2001 album Love's Arrival, Heard signed to the respected house label Trackmode, and its follow-up, 2003's Where Life Begins, also appeared on the label. ~ John Bush, All Music Guide"

Lyrics

I've been thinking about what you have done to me
The damage is much deeper than you'll ever see
Hit me like a hammer to my head
I wonder were you pushed or were you led?

Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to me?
Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to me?
The only one who knows the truth,
Man it's him me and you.

My friends they listen to the things i say
They listen and they hear more everyday
But i know they never understand it
Because it was no accident you planned it.

Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to me?
Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to me?
The only one who knows the truth,
Man it's him me and you.

One, two

I've been thinking about what you have done to me
The damage is much deeper than you'll ever see
Hit me like a hammer to my head
I wonder were you pushed or were you led?

Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to me?
Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to me?
The only one who knows the truth,
Man it's him me and you."

COMPUTER DATA - Healing [CLIPP049] 

“healing” begins to open up from the haze that “fog” leaves. The title has a lot of meaning behind this one, laced with distant vocals telling you to “let the healing into your heart”. The track encapsulates the title of the EP, an emotional shift towards happiness, peace of mind, hope, and (some) clarity. This track was written with a lot of personal hardships on CD’s mind from a recent relationship, and always pictured being entranced by it at the end of a long set in the club.

Video by POLYMORPHIAN RESILIENCE.

Composed of two artists, Fibula and Korman, the Polymorphian Resilience project fall into an abstract approach. The procedure is carried out in two stages:The capture of real images, which will then be reworked to create visualpatterns. The aim is to retranscribe the rhythm and atmosphere of the musicfrom motifs and shapes that pre-exist in the environment. The result is directlyaddressed to the senses of the spectator, who will associate the sensationsconveyed by these images with his or her own subjectivity.

Artist: Regal & Alien Rain
Title: Acid Affair
Label: Involve Records
Catalogue: INV024
Format: Vinyl
Genre: Electronic
Style: Techno
Release date: February 2019

Tracklist:
A1 Acid Affair Pt.1
B1 Acid Affair Pt.2

Regal strikes back on Involve Records with a brand new collaboration, this time with Acid head Milton Bradley a.k.a. Alien Rain. The record is another piece of the puzzle, where the label boss continues his exploration of the Techno universe with the help of artists that inspire him. The 24th release of Involve Records sees Regal and Bradley go deep delivering hypnotic 303 basslines and hammering percussions that point directly to the dancefloor, with chopped vocals adding tension to each cut. Acid Affair combines the best of both producers giving birth to a renewed take on Acid Techno. The two-track EP looks back to the origins of the etiquette, without missing the freshness of both artists’ current sonic approach to club-focused music. One not to miss for quirky sound lovers.

Layton Giordani feat. Danny Tenaglia - Live Again, Released 2017-10-09, DC180

Adam Beyer’s Drumcode is growing from strength to strength, year after year, with a non-stop release schedule showcasing both the labels new and most established artists with cutting edge techno beats. After 20 years since its inception, Drumcode continues to push the boundaries, firmly grounding their position as the world’s No.1 techno label.

Drumcode’s youngest rising star, Layton Giordani, exploded on to the scene after his debut album “Where It Begins” back in February, after scoring some of the biggest festivals in Europe this summer, he now returns with an exciting collab titled “Live Again”.

NY born and bred, Danny Tenaglia has always been a true inspiration for Layton since his teenage years, so when the opportunity to collaborate with the fellow NY legend was on the cards, it was a dream come true.

Danny and Layton join forces for the lead track ‘Live Again’. Its deep and dark with a slowly building pad wrapping around a modulating synthetic hook. The dark and effected vocal echo takes the track into a hypnotic vibe.

‘Take It Back’ delivers a pumping drive the moment it fires up. Snapping percussive force and an infectious rhythmic groove will unhinge dance floors nationwide, whilst ‘Secrets of Vibration’ has a rattling, yet blistering low end presence to it.

The New Yorkers unite on this energetic and exciting collab.

-D0igPDB_aw,Tito Puente -- Baila Mi Cha Cha Cha (VintageMusic.es),170,160752,VintageMusicFm,VintageMusicFm,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDzzc_du-9hCEFYRZfywhA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D0igPDB_aw,"Ernest Anthony Puente Jr. (*Nueva York, 20 de abril de 1923 - † 31 de mayo del 2000), conocido como Tito Puente, fue un músico puertorriqueño de salsa y jazz latino, de gran influencia en estos géneros.

Sus padres puertorriqueños Don Ernest Puente y Doña Ercilia Puente, nacido en el vecindario conocido como El Barrio de Nueva York. A menudo es llamado el primer músico ""puro"" de salsa. Se le conoce por las composiciones únicas que ayudaron de sostener su carrera por más de 50 años. Gracias a su técnica en el manejo de la percusión fue conocido como El Rey de los Timbales. Por estos años Tito tocaba en el Palladium que era la casa del mambo, y que junto a Machito y Tito Rodríguez hicieran conocido el mambo mundialmente.

Tito casi le quita el título de Rey del Mambo al mismísimo Dámaso Pérez Prado, músico que colaboró mucho con Beny Moré, cantante y sonero cubano residente en México. Sin embargo Puente no tocaba Mambo en general, pero en Nueva York siempre hubo confusión entre los ritmos cubanos.
Durante los años 1950, la popularidad de Puente llegó a su mayor nivel y logró que la música caribeña, como el mambo, el son y el cha cha cha llegara a una mayor audiencia. Luego incursionó en otros estilos como pop y bossa nova.
Sus participaciones junto a la cantante cubana La Lupe con temas como: ""Salve Plena"" se hicieron muy conocidos en muchos países de raíz latina, pero su sonido inconfundible al interpretar los timbales lo hizo conocido a nivel mundial, eso mismo sucedió cuando Tito Puente toco en Japón, inspirando a una agrupación de músicos japoneses a interpretar el género salsa, hablaría de la Orquesta de la Luz.

En 1992, Puente ganó el Premio Bicentenario de James Smithson y participó en la película: The Mambo Kings junto a Celia Cruz.
Ganó un premio Grammy por su grabación Mambo Birdland en la categoría de mejor disco de música caribeña tradicional en los primeros premios Latin Grammy.
Tito participó en varias producciones cinematográficas, como ""Salsa"" en 1988, ""The Mambo Kings"" en 1992 junto a Celia Cruz y Antonio Banderas y su última aparición la realizaría en un documental de Fernando Trueba, llamado: ""Calle 54"" en el que interpreta su tema de latin jazz: ""New Arrival"", con un excitante solo de congas interpretado por Giovanni Hidalgo, la la flauta de Dave Valentin.
Aunque como músico es mayormente reconocido, también se hizo más popular por las apariciones televisivas como en Plaza Sésamo interpretando su temas ""Ran Kan Kan"" y ""El Timbalón"". También, hizo una aparición como el mismo en el recordado capítulo en que se le incrimina haber asesinado al Señor Burns, en la serie animada Los Simpsons, en donde iba a dictar clases de música en la Primaria de Springfield.

Lyrics:

Through devotion, blessed are the children
Praise the teachers, that brings true love to many
Your devotion, opens all life's treasures
And deliverance, from the fruits of evil
So our mission to bring a melody
Ringin' voices, sing sweet harmony
For you here's a song to make your day brighter
One that will last you long through troubled days
Giving your heart the light to brighten
All of the dark that falls in your way
You need devotion, bless the children
Deliverance from the fruits of evil
You need devotion, bless the children
Deliverance from the fruits of evil

The highly anticipated project of long-time friends Hans Müller and Wolfgang Schneider bring to you LAZYWAX. Meeting at a discotheque in Berlin, the duo immediately began finding similar interests in their favourite Italia-disco producers and composers. Their instant connection lead to the birth of their first track ‘Pluto’ at Han’s studio on an 8 track tape machine, Minimoog Model-D and a Juno 60.

Since the inception of the LAZYWAX project, the pair have been devoted to the studio where they have been tirelessly working to create an array of quintessential discotheque tracks which draw on elements of modern European disco, whilst still paying homage to disco deities of the seventies and eighties. Although the project has been kept tightly-sealed over the years, the rumours have finally surfaced about a string of live performances set to take place in the near future.

For now enjoy the release of Lazywax Vol1

Tracklist:
A1: Rifts – Sharp Lank (Hedgehog Mix)
A2: Dajusch – Make Me Scream
B1: FJAAK – Back In The 70s

The Belgium-inspired Hedgehog Mix of Sharp Lank was too good not to put it out. Also, introducing Dajusch to Spandau 20 feels even more easy with a tune like Make Me Scream, which (unsurprisingly) is an absolute screamer. FJAAK round off the package with Back To The 70s, and so, SPANDAU20 004 is complete, another worthy entry to the series.

Pth79-bpgGs,Barry Manilow - Copacabana (At The Copa) Arista Records 1978,348,1457284,DiscoSaturdayNightTV,LetsGoDiscoTV,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZKgmF6bIOERGYssfOx965Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pth79-bpgGs,"""Copacabana"" also known as ""Copacabana (At the Copa)"", is a 1978 song which was sung by Barry Manilow and written by Manilow, Jack Feldman, Bruce Sussman and backing vocalist Ginger Blake, Laura Creamer and Linda Dillard.

The song was inspired by a conversation between Manilow and Sussman at the Copacabana Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, when they discussed whether there had ever been a song called ""Copacabana"". After returning to the US, Manilow — who, in the 1960s, had been a regular visitor to the Copacabana nightclub in New York City — suggested that Sussman and Feldman write the lyrics to a story song for him. They did so, and Manilow supplied the music.

The song's lyrics refer to a famous night club, the Copacabana: ""at the Copa, Copacabana, the hottest spot north of Havana"". The beginning is set in the late 1940s and tells the story of Lola, a showgirl, and her lover Tony, a bartender at the club who she loses in a fight with Rico, a Mafia boss who takes an interest in Lola, calls her over to his table (most likely to try to seduce her); in response, Tony tries to protect Lola from Rico, and in the ensuing fight one of the men shoots the other. The ending is set thirty years later in the 1970s, where the club has been transformed into a disco. Lola has grown old and is alone and insane, pining for her lost love Tony.

The recording was used as incidental music in the 1978 movie Foul Play, which starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn, and has been featured in over a dozen other films since. The single version clocks in at 4:08, the Extended Disco version is titled ""Copacabana (At The Copa) (Disco)"" and is 5:46. As opposed to a commercial 12"" single, the extended version was on the flip side of the 45 and can also be found on Manilow's first Greatest Hits double album.

It debuted on Billboard magazine's Top 40 chart on July 7, 1978, and peaked at #8. It peaked at #42 in the United Kingdom the same year. The track was Manilow's first gold single for a song he recorded and released.  Additionally, the lyrics to ""Copacabana"" earned Manilow his first and only Grammy Award for Pop Male Vocalist in February 1979.

Manilow released a Spanish version titled ""Copacabana (En El Copa)"" shortly after the English version was released. Though popular in dance clubs catering to Latin audiences, the Spanish version failed to chart on Billboard's Hot 100 chart.

In 1985, Manilow and his collaborators Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman expanded the song into a full length, made-for-television musical, also called Copacabana, writing many additional songs and expanding the plot suggested by the song. This film version was then further expanded by Manilow, Feldman, and Sussman into a full-length, two-act stage musical that ran at the Prince of Wales Theatre on London's West End for two years prior to a lengthy tour of the UK. An American production was later mounted that toured the US for over a year. Over 200 productions of the show have since been mounted worldwide.

Barry Manilow is an American singer-songwriter, arranger, musician, and producer with a career that has spanned over 50 years. He is best known for a long string of hit recordings such as ""Mandy"", ""Can't Smile Without You"", and ""Copacabana (At the Copa)"". 

Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
 With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
 She would merengue and do the cha-cha
 And while she tried to be a star
 Tony always tended bar
 Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4
 They were young and they had each other
 Who could ask for more?

[Chorus]

 At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)
 The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
 At the copa (CO!) Copacabana
 Music and passion were always the fashion
 At the copa.... they fell in love

 His name was Rico
 He wore a diamond
 He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there
 And when she finished,he called her over
 But Rico went a bit to far
 Tony sailed across the bar
 And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
 There was blood and a single gun shot
 But just who shot who?

[Chorus]

 At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)
 The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
 At the copa (CO!) Copacabana
 Music and passion were always the fashion
At the copa... she lost her love

Copa, Copacabana, Copacabana ahh
Copa, Copacabana, like in Havana, Copacabana
Music and passion always in fashion

 Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl,
 But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show
 Now it's a disco, but not for Lola,
 Still in dress she used to wear,
 Faded feathers in her hair
 She sits there so refined, and drinks herself half-blind
 She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
 Now she's lost her mind

[Chorus]

 At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)
 The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
 At the copa (CO!) Copacabana
 Music and passion were always the fashion
 At the copa... don't fall in love
 Don't fall in love

Now four releases in, Razor-N-Tape Reserve continues to deliver the deepness with this EP from the Netherlands’ Junktion. Although a relative upstart on the scene, Junktion has been getting some serious heads nodding lately with releases on Sleazy Beats and Outplay, and the Hot & Bothered EP continues to define his dusty and organic sound. From the summery ease of the title track, to the fresh take on the oft-sampled 'I'm Wishin' to the discofied chugger 'Fling Cleaning' followed by the slow-burning 'Visions of You,' this EP is a beautiful listen from beginning to end. And the kids are gonna dig it too."

https://k7.lnk.to/Vietnam

Artist: Red Axes
Label: !K7 Records
Genre: Electronic
Release date: 24 May 2019

Tracklist:
Ho Chi Min (Feat. Beo Dat May Troi & Hcmc Students)
Hanoi (Feat. Co Doi Thuong Ngan & Viet Rice Band)
Phu Quok (Feat. Minh Duong)
Hue (Feat. Music Acadamy Students)

A year after Red Axes’s musical adventures took them through the sounds and scenes of Africa, they return with a second EP in the Trips series that finds them exploring the rich rhythms of Vietnam.

This project is a multi media venture combining music, film and travel in pursuit of extra ordinary collaborations. It finds the esteemed pair made up of Niv Arzi and Dori Sadovnik explore local cultures and traditions, link up with local musicians and record them playing indigenous instruments as well as presenting workshops for youth music schools. It comes after the Garzen Records bosses have established their unique mix of synths, guitars and genres as diverse as house, acid and leftfield experimentalism on vital labels from Phantasy to Dark Entries.

Opener ‘Ho Chi Minh’ is a brisling track with funky bass loops and the hustle and bustle of a market square infusing the organic house grooves. Local percussion, jazz keys and vocal coos all add to the richness of this most uplifting beat. ‘Hanoi’ is even more exotic thanks to the enchanting lead vocal, jungle bird calls and low slung bass, while ‘Phu Quoc’ gets more rave, with phased bass riding up and down there sale, an intoxicating lead line that sounds something like a didgeridoo and a manic synth that darts about the mix with disorienting effects. Closer ‘Hue’ is a blissful and almost Balearic beat with a shimmering lead melody line and layer upon layer of wind instruments, claps and hits that speak directly to your soul.

The accompanying film captures the essence of the trip, shows some of the recording sessions and local life in Vietnam, from beach parties to incense rituals via communal dances in public spaces, all of which inspired and infuse this record. As such it is a fantastically colourful and immersive EP that takes you to the other side of the world with real authenticity."

East London loft party The Disco Express serves up its first taste as a record label. With its straight to the dance floor energy, the landmark release instills all the feelings of the hedonistic nights and flamboyant dances that have become renowned in the capital.


Kicking off is Soundsmith with 'Disco Ride'; a flawlessly reworked edit of The Spinner's 80's dance floor classic. With its soaring strings, euphoric vocals and outrageously funky guitar hooks, this high octane anthem will be the choice track for DJ sets worldwide. Here, Soundsmith pulls out the stops with a rip roaring, disco belter to set the tone for the VA EP.

The Silver Rider takes time away from farm-life to drop two heart-tender disco missives, while splitting the slab with Londoner, Bustin' Loose, who makes his Whiskey Disco debut.

Kicking things off on the a-side is The Silver Rider with 'Roundhouse,' a reworking of a stone-cold classic that injects club ready beats and high energy vibes into some very recognizable sample sources. Next up, TSR keeps the energy, but adds a sunkissed breeze to the mix with 'You're The One,' a super smooth and groovy number perfect for top-down cruising or pool side jamming.

Flip it over for a powerful pair of cuts from Bustin' Loose... the founder of London's, The Disco Express party series and a burgeoning producer with previous releases on Toy Tonics and Roux Records. 'These Ol' Days' gets us started with proper warm up tackle as a silky, filtered loop evolves and opens atop funky guitar loops and sultry vocals. Move the needle to the inside cut and we take the energy up a notch with 'Home Way Phase,' who's galloping percussion creates an urgency for shimmering strings and horn stabs to perfectly punctuate... PROPER!

Originally from Bristol UK, Ben J Worrall aka Crackazat is a musician, producer and composer, with a formal background in jazz composition. Now relocated to Sweden, where he releases through the Local Talk label, his productions and remixes have been gaining support from Disclosure, Detroit Swindle, Homework.

For his Period Works EP for ZR he searched the extensive catalogue of ZR accapella's and blended parts of them to create three slamming new productions.

""Universal Love"" hits the right balance between the classic house sound and Crackazat's trademark warm, jazzy take on electronic music. ""What You're Feeling"" heads into more classic piano house territory with low-slung disco beats, while ""Crystal Eyes"" goes for futuristic chords with funk led guitars over a big bass groove.

DJ Reactions:

Groove Armada - Great release, really musical, diggin’ these

Curve Records​ are delighted to welcome Barcelona-based newcomer ​Guim​ to the label. 
His latest offering ​Hylian Jams ​blends influences from 00’s garage, Henry Wu and Zelda. Inspired one night by a Wu x K15 Boiler Room set, he sat down and whipped up these four beauties especially for us. 
 
For such a young producer, Guim carves out a surprisingly mature nod to classic UKG and broken beat with this gorgeous EP. 
Fans of ​Ben Hauke​ will be surprised to hear a remix that steps completely away from his usual bruk style, delivering a huge straight up 4/4 progressive house jam to wrap up the release.

iJj1Sduv3u4,DOS - Lucid Dreams,351,11090,hurfyd,hurfyd,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzeR0_RWnpNHe6y4DTLwE5Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJj1Sduv3u4,"https://runningoutofsteam.bandcamp.com

Austrian producer DOS rolls through making his mark on the first release of new label, Running Out of Steam, already scoring a modern summer classic house infused release to make memories too.

EP track title 'Lucid Dreams' entwines twinkling, twitching vocals with deep compressed pads for the summer hazy days ahead with tropical synth melodies blending into a euphoric after-hours haze.

'Work That' launches into a nostalgic blend of crunchy breaks and endearing silky chords. Levitating through the track, it's building vocal line draws to an ecstatic drop for the living room dancefloor. Get the windows open and feel the wind in your hair for this sunrise belter.

On the flip side DOS injects his punchy pads and dusty 90's vocals for a cheeky four to the floor house anthem. Broken beat drum hooks move in unison with mellow synth lines to time travel back to better times.

‘Manta’ sees out the labels first outing with an epic bang, pulsating bass battles elegantly crunching with trance-esque sound pallets and classic jungle breaks."

This track can be found on U.K.-produced LP ""Possessed/Pin-Up Girls.""   (Cat.# AMY 734)

As an American, I had minimal exposure to European radio. I do not know how much airplay this tune or mix had back in the day.

My first music loves are old skool piano/hardcore piano and Italo Dance. However, I will upload tunes of other categories which I believe are unique, quality, underplayed, and worthy of remembrance.

London's Chris Trowbridge comes to the mysterious Cheeks with a fine contemporary disco number that's served in two contrasting but complementary mixes. Head for the original if its authentically 70s-sounding vibes you're after: drenched in strings, guitar and brass, 'Loving You' could have been dropped at The Loft or Paradise Garage and no one would have batted an eyelid, while the accompanying Jive Talk Remix is a much more obviously post-house affair. So essentially, you've got one mix aimed at clubs like Horse Meat Disco, and one for places like Glitterbox... which should be enough to ensure this gets plenty of dancefloor rotation for the next month or two!

Still in school, Tom and his friend Thorsten Adler started experimenting in electronic dance music and landed instant clubhits with their several projects. The breakthrough came in 1992 with ""Arpeggiators"" when they got signed by Harthouse, the young label of Sven Väth. Since then, they produced produced one record after the other under project names like for example Microbots (Overdrive) and Psycho Drums (R&S).
Tom worked at a number of labels as A&R and consequently followed his path becoming one of the most popular rave and club DJs. Together with Andy Düx he was resident DJ at Dorian Gray, Frankfurt Airport and was responsible for the Friday session between 1993 and 1995.
Working as the ""Microbots"", Tom and Thorsten have made many excursions into a deeper genre, but just as well suited for the dancefloor. In 1994 Tom Wax and Thorsten Adler brought their very personal project into life named 'AWeX' (Adler-Wax-eXperiments). In the beginning they made it for fun and to have an experimental field without any musical limits. But after their first 12inch 'It´s Our future' became THE anthem of 1995 and the Berlin Love Parade, they had their biggest success up to date . The follow-up 'Back On Plastic' climbed up to rank 32 of the official German charts so that an album was the logical consequence.

In 1995 he changed his well known artist name ""DJ Tom"" into ""Tom Wax"" to avoid confusions due to the fact that along with the big techno hype in Germany a lot of other DJ´s called themselves DJ Tom (Tom = short name of Thomas)."

A little tribute to Dave Greenfield (keyboardist with The Stranglers who died with Covid-19 last week) and Paul Desmond (saxophonist with the Dave Brubeck quartet - the anniversary of his death is at the end of this month). Also because I've been enjoying editing videos and recording stuff over the last couple of months.

A couple of people have asked how I made this video so here we go -
I took a clip from a 1964 live version of Take Five (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT9Eh8wNMkw) and made the drum loop by chopping up the intro and turning it from 5/4 into the 3/4 - 4/4 groove that Golden Brown has. The upright bass sound is sequenced from Logic, and the piano part was played in using one of the piano sounds from a Nord Electro 5D. Then I played the sax part over the top (I play a King Zephyr alto and for this I used a hard rubber Yanigasawa mouthpiece rather than my usual bright Guardala).
The video was then edited using the clip I'd taken the drum loop from.

The Silver Rider takes time away from farm-life to drop two heart-tender disco missives, while splitting the slab with Londoner, Bustin' Loose, who makes his Whiskey Disco debut.

Kicking things off on the a-side is The Silver Rider with 'Roundhouse,' a reworking of a stone-cold classic that injects club ready beats and high energy vibes into some very recognizable sample sources. Next up, TSR keeps the energy, but adds a sunkissed breeze to the mix with 'You're The One,' a super smooth and groovy number perfect for top-down cruising or pool side jamming.

Flip it over for a powerful pair of cuts from Bustin' Loose... the founder of London's, The Disco Express party series and a burgeoning producer with previous releases on Toy Tonics and Roux Records. 'These Ol' Days' gets us started with proper warm up tackle as a silky, filtered loop evolves and opens atop funky guitar loops and sultry vocals. Move the needle to the inside cut and we take the energy up a notch with 'Home Way Phase,' who's galloping percussion creates an urgency for shimmering strings and horn stabs to perfectly punctuate... PROPER!

Released - 6th April 2020
BUY FROM - https://lazywax.bandcamp.com/releases

The highly anticipated project of long-time friends Hans Müller and Wolfgang Schneider bring to you LAZYWAX. Meeting at a discotheque in Berlin, the duo immediately began finding similar interests in their favourite Italia-disco producers and composers. Their instant connection lead to the birth of their first track ‘Pluto’ at Han’s studio on an 8 track tape machine, Minimoog Model-D and a Juno 60.

Since the inception of the LAZYWAX project, the pair have been devoted to the studio where they have been tirelessly working to create an array of quintessential discotheque tracks which draw on elements of modern European disco, whilst still paying homage to disco deities of the seventies and eighties. Although the project has been kept tightly-sealed over the years, the rumours have finally surfaced about a string of live performances set to take place in the near future.

For now enjoy the release of Lazywax Vol1

Hailing from New York, the dance-disco outfit Indeep scored a massive hit in 1983 with ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life."" Led by songwriter Michael Cleveland, the band issued a full-length album under the same title shortly thereafter, but with the disco movement almost extinct by this time (and with the emergence of such styles as rap), Indeep subsequently had a tough time following up their smash and were delegated to ""one-hit wonder"" status. The act continued recording into the mid-'80s, and issued a few quickly forgotten albums: When Boys Talk, Buffalo Bill, and The Record Keeps Spinning. But the group's lone hit has become a dancefloor classic over the years, and 1991 saw the release of the 23-track best-of set, The Collection."

I dont expect all of you to like this one, this tune leans more towards the hardcore acid music fans, its not so easy to take in. It´s almost like an emmanuel top tune.

WRXX4 is Y U QT’s first release on Warehouse Rave. Leicester based Garage new boys making some Melodic upbeat Bangers.Track 1 Can’t Hold it in is a Melodic Journey of Baselines/Strings/Vocals and skippy drums that compliment and set the tone for the EP. I Wanna Know is an upbeat Garage/House Club Track. Much like I wanna know we have Deeper Love a Housey/Garage Club tool With some Big basses and Nice Breakdowns. Fort Wibbler is a 4x4 Heater with a Dub Break down Champions taking the EP a little Darker. Slew Dem is a 2 step Bass Driven track ending the EP off in a moody but still upbeat style of Y U QT.

DJ Shadow, widely acknowledged as a crucial figure in the development of experimental, instrumental hip-hop, has returned with ‘The Mountain Will Fall’ via Mass Appeal Records [and Believe Digital in France]. His first full length release since 2011, the 12-track album finds DJ Shadow exploring new realms in addition to the deep samples and kinetic soundscapes that helped to launch his career 20 years ago. On ‘The Mountain Will Fall’ he’s shifted further toward original composition, a vast experimentation of beats and textures, synthesizers and live instruments including horns and woodwinds. The album features Run The Jewels, Nils Frahm, Matthew Halsall, Ernie Fresh and more.

what should we say about this unbelievable tune. we could tell a lot of stories. for example: we worked for ZYX Music, the company which also had a label deal for GAS (Germany / Austria / Switzerland).we worked at ZYX as an A&R Manager in general and as a label manager regrading the Strictly Rhythm Connection. the track caused such a storm, that we even got phone calls from other labels like MFS / Berlin, label of Paul van Dyk at the time, good friends of ours, that they desperetaley would like to licence the tune. But of course this tune was so ahead of everything other... that we released it on our own... sold many many copies on vinyl and CD over months... and we assume even today the track is selling well... as it is also today just outstanding...

of course we do not own any rights but thought it is a good idea to share our musical roots and so support their / our music"

Samim has justly gained a reputation over the past few years as one of the most innovative contemporary dance music producers, and also as one of its most consistently exciting live performers. Berlin´s Get Physical are proud to present his new solo album, ´Flow´, the debut full-length release under his own name.

The talented Iranian-Swiss first came to the attention of the dance community with his productions as Samim & Michal (with Michal Ho). Releases on labels like Kindisch, Freizeitglauben and Tuning Spork marked the duo out as big names for the future. In 2004 due to a serious Illness, Samim was forced to take a break; he returned to the fray shortly after, newly focused and determined to push himself and his creativity as far as he possibly could. A move to Berlin enabled numerous collaboration incl. the Fuckpony Project, which resulted in an album for Get Physical, ´Children of Love´, which was as celebrated for its production nous as for its wicked sense of humour. Samim also released an album as Bearback, and 12""s on respected labels like Circus Company and Moon Harbour. On top of this, his remix talents have been in high demand, leading him to rework tracks for the likes of Fourtwenty, Dirtybird, Highgrade and Crosstown Rebels (his mix of Pier Bucci´s ´Hay Consuela´was a club smash). Samim´s new LP under his own name is a dizzying document of dance futurism and, as the title suggests, for all its experimentation, for all its twists and tangents, this is an album which never loses its sense of direction, nor its commitment to twisted dancefloor funk. This, ladies and gentlemen, is Flow.

Lyrics:

If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because I'm me
Because she said, ""He's the one that drill the charms
Honey let's go wrong""
I just want to know
What's wrong with me?
Being in love with you

Yeah
9th grade had the jingles of the swinging rainbow jacket
Law slain go [?] only Django
[?]
That's where my props go
That's where my pops went
See my percentage is a pennant to the planet
Knock it out the ball park, Frankie
I should not tire this tire
To a better love, let the wings spread
It'll always come back, baby
Come back, shellac black, baby
A come back, flat black paint on a Chevy

If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because I'm me
Because I'm me
Because I'm me

Never mind my tone when I told Pretty Tony
Listen to my tone, you ain't catchin' you a Tony
Award-winning walk when you running with a shottie
Why you running from us?
Why you messing with us?
We ain't got no guns, we just let the bears witness
The Grizzly, maybe Polar
You ain't ready, you ain't ready 'ready rolled up
Pulling a machete, cut the bamboo paper
And let's roll out baby

I just want to know
What's wrong with me?

""Watch the shit, it's good"""

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
""There must be some kind of way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word""
Hey!

[Verse 2]
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late
Hey!

[Guitar Solo]

Hey!

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well, uh, outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey!

[Outro]
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

5WLH73LpuNg,Axel Boman - Purple Drank (PAMPA004),438,55276,Pampa Records Official,UCOFJQmSjRsHqudPMldT4GTw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFJQmSjRsHqudPMldT4GTw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WLH73LpuNg,"Release Date: 30th august 2010 - available here: https://pamparecords.com/products/axel-boman-holy-love

For the fourth release on DJ Koze and Marcus Fink’s Pampa imprint, hyperactive hotshot house hunk Axel Boman steps up and delivers a stunning debut EP for the label. Since many years an important force on the small but friendly Swedish club scene, and one third of the Studio Barnhus crew together with Kornél Kovács and Petter, Axel is as experienced a producer as his ideas are fresh. This tattooed Swede often talks about creating “worlds” rather than “tracks”, and on his ""Holy Love"" EP we are transported to three very different places indeed.

The title track, a collaboration with vocalist J Jonason, invites you to take part in a lazy afternoon cocktail party onboard an old sailing boat in Gothenburg’s archipelago. Ten City are mixing up the White Russians and Giorgio Moroder’s estranged Swedish grandson is peeling the shrimp. You fall asleep on the patio and wake up in a sweaty basement later that night.

Through the shabby speakers of one of those small but friendly Stockholm night clubs, you hear “Purple Drank”, a sleazy, sexy number that draws influences from Houston style screw music, classic deep house and hypnotic techno. The irresistible vocal hook – “I woke up with your name on my lips” has already echoed across dance floors from Tokyo to Amsterdam. Bouncy yet unsettling, this track is probably the most obvious DJ’s favorite on the EP.

Morning comes yet again, and for the after party we head to Axel’s private rooftop terrace in sunny Gröndal. The laptop speakers are banging out the most loved up piano loop you ever heard. “Not So Much” is as simple and naïve as Axel Boman’s haircut, a perfect ending to a perfect night and a perfect little record from this imperfect genius of a dance music producer.

“Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless – like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."" The steadily brilliant French producer Nathan Melja - who's made the rounds between choice outlets over the past half decade, from Mister Saturday Nights to Antinote, via Ninja Tune offshoot Technicolour and Opal Tapes, seems to have learnt Bruce Lee's lesson by heart, and his seamlessly fluid, no-nonsense debut foray on KOC is here to potently cement his status as one of Europe's number one club trailblazers, and one that knows all too well how to turn any dancefloor into an infinity pool of pure liquid euphoria.

Drawing its name from the physiological and psychological process that results in a confusion of one's sensory perceptions, 'Synesthesia' is indeed the kind of club single that shall trigger off massive reaction amongst right-minded bipeds and chromakey house suckers. Straightforward club business done right, Melja's original is a vivid kaleidoscope of skittish drums, swampy bass stabs and a well-rounded, supremely curvy synthwork, tailored to take ravers on a flash journey through space and time without the help of Richard Branson or Elon Tusk (pun intended).

Called in on remix duty, TTT affiliate and Incienso co-founder Anthony Naples delivers a more fragmented and ambientish variation, though functional and club-ready in its own right. Brushing even wider verbed-out pad tapestries for your brain to wander in, the track expands to deeper organic horizons with a field-depth that can not but recall that of the KLF and Bochum Welt's emotional soundscaping. Meanwhile, Karenn half Pariah takes care of whelming us deep into more techno-friendly terrains, true to his ever masterly touch for epic buildups and multi-level textural innovation, bringing up the acidic phlegm of Melja's original as he treats us to a carefully orchestrated ballet of synthetic whorls, contemplative chords and propulsive drum programming."

It's hard to believe it has been 3 years since his last appearance on Heist, but with 'Y'miss me baby?', Nebraska takes back center stage with another release full of disco flavored electronics. Italian disco man-of-the-moment Giovanni Damico comes along for the ride and delivers a stunning 80âs flavored remix.

The Pharcyde ""Drop"" from the album Labcabincalifornia. Video directed by Spike Jonze.

It took three years for The Pharcyde to follow up on their debut release, Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde. Not that they didn’t keep busy in that period with supporting slots for De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest as well as a successful spot on Lollapalooza's 1994 tour. Of course J-Swift had parted ways with the group just before the conclusion of the Bizarre Ride sessions. Rather than try to out an out replace Swift, production on Labcabincalifornia was handled by the Pharcyde’s own Bootie Brown, Fatlip and Slimkid3 along with contributions from Diamond D, M-Walk and very notably the work of a recent arrival in LA, Jay Dee aka J Dilla. The resulting project, Labcabincalifornia, maybe calmer than the group’s debut but it s no less warped with stand out cuts like “She Said”, “Drop”, and “Runnin’”. The lead single, “Drop” was supported by one of the best videos ever directed by Spike Jonze and along with the above mentioned singles propelled solid sales on Labcabincalifornia ultimately securing it’s own position in the pantheon of must have records. 

“If Labcabincalifornia came out today, boasting production by J Dilla on seven out of 17 tracks would be a big deal…” - Complex Magazine

↓ LYRICS ↓

Get up and shake it up
It's time that you listen up and hear the call
They love the waterbed and not your own fire packed against the wall

Don't stop
Try to make your mark and make your mind up
Don't stop
Work it out and try to make it

Randy
Get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better

Randy
You don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
You'll know you are loved
When it's time
Don't you know
Play with fire
When you know you've arrived

When it's time
Keep it slow
Shoot it high
Hold on to what you've got and strike while the iron's hot

Put up a fight
Those days are good and gone
Keep up, keep on going strong through the night
Don't stop
Try to make your mark and make your mind up

Don't stop
Work it out and try to make it
Randy
Get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better

Randy
You don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
You'll know you are loved
When it's time
Don't you know
Play with fire
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Keep it slow
Shoot it high
Oh

Feels like the latest version
Now that the wind is turning soft and cool
Next up a new dimension
Find something fresh and someone just for you

Don't stop
Try to make your mark and make your mind up
Don't stop
Work it out and try to make it

Randy
Get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better

Randy
You don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
You'll know you are loved
When it's time
Don't you know
Play with fire
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Keep it slow
Shoot it high"

Debuting on Rekids, Laurent Garnier & Chambray collaborate for a colossal single entitled ‘Feelin’ Good’ featuring two outstanding remixes from label owner Radio Slave.

Having supported Rekids for many years in his sets across the globe, it only made sense for Laurent Garnier to drop one of his finest productions to date on the label. Although the legendary Frenchman has kept busy producing movie soundtracks (‘Paris Est A Nous’) and remixes in recent years, this is his first full release since 2017. He’s joined in the studio by Chambray, a Berlin-based producer known for releasing on Figure, Unknown To The Unknown and Jimmy Edgar’s Ultramajic.

Opening with sporadic battle cries, stabbing claps and powerful bass sequences before rapturous piano melodies come into effect – ‘Feelin’ Good’ is undoubtedly one of this year’s biggest tracks. On the flip, Radio Slave assembles two contrasting remixes that do just as much damage: the first is an atmospheric number that marches forward using precision kicks, rattling percussion and rising pads, whilst the ‘Revenge Mix’ cranks things up a notch with its crunchy breaks before introducing the original’s blissful keys."

Detroit, Michigan was a fertile breeding ground for industry and the arts during its best days. The Domingos first got together in 1954 with charter members Billy Henderson, Henry Fambrough, Pervis Jackson, C. P. Spencer, and James Edwards. Edwards was the first to depart and smooth voiced Bobby Smith was recruited. Then Spencer left with George Dixon taking over and the group changed their name to The Spinners in 1961. 

Their first single ""That's What Girls Are Made For"" on Harvey Fuqua's Tri-Phi Records went top 30 in the US and introduced the world to Bobby Smith who would be the voice on most of the Spinners recordings including this one. After a few more personnel changes, Tri-Phi got bought out by Berry Gordy and The Spinners became part of the Motown stable of artists. Excited as they were to be signed to such a prestigious label, it was not long before that enthusiasm dimmed along with their commercial appeal. 

Motown responded by having the members act as tour personnel babysitters, drivers and administrative help, moving them to the VIP imprint, a third rate label. The Spinners had little success being with Motown and were more than ready to move on when their contract expired. GC Cameron, the voice on ""It's A Shame"" left the band and was replaced by Philippe Wynne in early 1972. On the word of Aretha Franklin they were signed to Atlantic and paired with producer Jimmy Roach who cut four sides with them. Those tracks were shelved once label president Henry Allen heard them and set about looking for another producer. 

Enter Thom Bell, who Allen hired to work for Atlantic. Given a choice of any artist on the roster, he picked the Spinners as he had been a fan of their music since their first hit on Tri-Phi Records ""That's What Girls Are For"" in 1961. During the summer of 1972, Bell worked with the group on four sides, since Atlantic had already spent $20,000$ on the abandoned Jimmy Roach sessions and did not want to spend much more. 

He composed a song written in three chords and took it to Sigma Studios, home of the Sound Of Philadelphia. Veteran musicians Bobby Eli, Ronnie Baker, Earl Young, Roland Chambers, Larry Washington and Vince Montana played on the track, with Don Renaldo directing the strings. The musicians mused at the simplicity of the song and set about jamming, taking all of forty minutes to record the music track. 

Bell's writing partner lyricist Linda Creed, was in the process of setting up her wedding and unable to help with the lyrics, begged off. Thom scoured the Sigma offices to find a lyricist and then walked into Bunny Sigler's office to find Phil Hurtt who had gone to high school with Bell and was more than ready to write lyrics that would fit Bell's exacting standards. Overnight, Hurtt wrote the words that would create an R&B classic. 

The Spinners went in and nailed the vocals on ""I'll Be Around"". Alas, it was relegated to the B side of ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" which was their official debut Atlantic single. DJs who played the record, flipped the single and found the hit in playing ""I'll Be Around"" and forgetting the other side. They were right as the tune took off in a big way and proved that DJ's were influencing the pop music landscape. The single hit the Hot 100 chart for the week ending September 16, 1972 at #74 and peaked at #3 but spent five weeks at #1 on the R&B charts, an auspicious start to a stellar third career for a supposedly third rate band."

""The Bomb! (These Sounds Fall into My Mind)"" is a house music track by The Bucketheads, released in 1995. ""The Bomb!"" was later dubbed into the project's sole album All in the Mind. It was a commercial hit in the UK in winter/spring 1995, reaching #5 in the singles chart.

The track was produced by Masters At Work member Kenny ""Dope"" Gonzalez, and features samples from Chicago's ""Street Player"". One sample was later used by Nicola Fasano VS. Pat Rich for ""75, Brazil Street"", which was later used by Pitbull with ""I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)"". The subtitle of the song is a mondegreen; the actual lyrics taken from the Chicago sample are ""Street sounds swirling through my mind...""."

DJ Koze might be one of the world's best producers, but above all he's a DJ, and it's his DJ ear that governs. Just as in a great set, so with his releases: “Seeing Aliens” came out of nowhere, a big buzzing beast of a track, to announce that Koze was back on the scene and prime everyone for the coming album, knock knock. But now that Koze has your attention, it's time to remind everyone what's most important about club music, pull things back, take a turn to the left, and get deep into the groove.

Thus “Pick Up”: the second single from knock knock is 100% pure groove, doubly so in the extended 12” version. In a sense it's incredibly familiar – it is essentially a filter disco record, very close to something you could imagine coming out of Paris around the turn of the millennium. But of course, this is Koze. Nothing is normal or familiar in his world, and he's taken this most foundational of clubland staples into new territory. Flipping samples of Gladys Knight & the Pips “Neither One Of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)” and Melba Moore’s “Pick Me Up, I’ll Dance“, it creates something completely airborne, shot through with emotions such as gods must feel: not quite explicable to the human mind but strong enough to knock you off your feet. In its way it's absolutely as powerful as “Seeing Aliens”, but it comes in like the proverbial iron fist in a glove of velvet.

Music taken from the Album ""knock knock“ - Release date: May 4th, 2018

Their instant connection lead to the birth of their first track ‘Pluto’ at Han’s studio on an 8 track tape machine, Minimoog Model-D and a Juno 60.

Since the inception of the LAZYWAX project, the pair have been devoted to the studio where they have been tirelessly working to create an array of quintessential discotheque tracks which draw on elements of modern European disco, whilst still paying homage to disco deities of the seventies and eighties. Although the project has been kept tightly-sealed over the years, the rumours have finally surfaced about a string of live performances set to take place in the near future.

For now enjoy the release of Lazywax Vol1

Liverpool Disco Festival gets set to launch their exciting new label venture, LDF Recordings, with full support on our first release from Giles Peterson, Tony Humphries, Lakuti, David Harness, Jimpster, Mendel, Marcel Vogal, Fish Go Deep and many more!! We kick off proceedings with a sublime soulful groover from talented US songbird Angel-A, produced by one of the leading players on the Chicago scene, Rahaan. 'True To Myself’ carries a warm deep house vibe teased with jazzy undercurrents, elevated by a candid soul-drenched vocal from Angel-A, whose silky tones speak of self-love and integrity. Also on the package, Karizma amps up the deepness, injecting trippy beat wizardry and hypnotic key washes on a superb dub version.

This weeks ear pleaser is from Austrian producer DOS, and the track ‘HIGH’ - which can only be described as a jackin’ combo of calming vocals, classic rave bird samples, and doofin’ bass line that all unites to keep you from getting lost in the ambients. Throw in a healthy dose of swinging HH grooves and stab chords galore and this track has us getting mad high.

It’s my great pleasure to announce the second release on LFT, and my debut record as my birth name, Jordon Alexander, “THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER”.

These songs were written over the last couple months of what was one of, if not the most turbulent, formative and important years of my life.

I thought they were the perfect introduction to all the new material I have coming in 2019, as Mall Grab, and Jordon Alexander.

“More Than I Ever Thought I Could” is an electro-esque excursion which has been serving as a last track in many of my sets and I’ve been waiting to share since it was recorded. The b side “The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter” named after Carson Mcullers’ 1940 novel, samples the film adaptation and is a melancholy instrumental journey recalling endless hours spent daydreaming looking out train and car windows around the globe.

Label: Pont Neuf Records
Artist: KX9000
Format: Vinyl
Cat Number: PN011
EP Title: Ultra Loisir EP
Release Date: October 18th, 2019
Support it: https://lnk.to/UltraLoisir

Dive into the fantastic and jazzy-disco house influenced world of KX9000! A year after the release of his EP Trouver X acclaimed by Mixmag or XLR8R, followed by another maxi called Kaiju & Features on the German label Blaq Numbers - on which appeared some of the new French house scene’s most essential producers such as Tour-Maubourg, Mangabey and ALVA - the young Parisian has emerged as one of the most remarkable producers of the moment.

He is now back on Pont Neuf with Ultra Loisir. Halfway between a bustling French house and Japanese city-pop influences, KX9000 offers a delicious 5-tracker, which can be tasted without moderation. A true collection of musical games with varied influences and singular production balanced between house sounds, electro funk and touches of nu-jazz.

«Raf’s Baggies» comes to close the first part of this new maxi with a deep house oriented travel, supported by an acid bassline, as groovy as effective.

Lyrics 

Im working off my ass
Every single day
For the minimum wage
And I don’t get paid 
I don’t have a house 
I can’t pay the rent
Im sleeping on the floor in a car in a tent

So i’m stressed on tick 
I’m stressed on tick 
Im stressed about money
cuz i’m gacked on anger
i’m stressed on tick 
i’m stressed on tick
i’m stressed on tick 
cuz i’m gacked on anger

I wanna help out the people on the street
But how can I help them when I cant afford to eat
How do I survive? How do I get by?
I cant go to sleep cuz theres trouble in my mind"

https://www.juno.co.uk/products/hdsn-whiplash/760709-01/

HDSN has a style all his own, but his disco tingled, futuristic, groovy sound evolved from the likes of Paul Johnson or Armand Van Helden who played around with old records using samplers and drum machines in the 90s, when House Music was mostly an underground phenomenon that could only be heard at nightclubs or through homemade DJ mixes. So it´s hardly surprising that his latest EP sounds like it was straight out of this golden era - with “Whiplash"" he delivers one of the best records to hit the market yet, pure vibes and so ecstatic through out the course of all four tracks that are outstanding. HDSN is the best at holding you in a groove, keeping you there using chopped samples, and forward moving drum patterns like sweeping sensations. NBASTWAX009 hits all the right buttons, taking you on a journey and we promise it works every time, anywhere to anyone like pure magic! Tracks like these are the reason we are so excited about this era - they have the quality to tell a story but are far from boring - music that feels natural & alive. Records like this don’t grow old like us … rather, every time you hear them they take you back their time. Grab ya copy #datsoulthang

When a smart fella whipped his sax out just minutes into our YouTube debut, he caused a fair few bubbles to say the least.
“What’s the track @ 6:20?” barked BigGirl4000
“Anyone got an ID?” SilentSniper66 squealed remorsefully.
The questions came pouring in and we kept our big hanging traps clenched … until now.

Recorded during his infamous live performance at the Wigflex x Magicwire party, the deep twatting of cork on wood and quantised clinks in a vigorous toast fizz away under 8 minutes of synth, sax and guitar, filtered through a ruddy fine beverage.

So now you know, it ain’t started 'til the big girl barks ;)

Title: Mi Rumba EP 
Release Date: 12th September 2011 
Format: Digital 
Cat No: FRD156 

Kyodai means brothers in Japanese and that's about as good a clue as you're getting as to who these two producers are, suffice to say they regularly release under a variety of different names for labels such as Compost, Odori and Lovemonk. 

On this, their Freerange debut, Kyodai get busy on two original tracks which fuse elements of deep house, melodic techno and afro into a high energy concoction which fits in with the current Freerange sound just perfectly. The lead track entitled Mi Rumba keeps its cards close to it's chest for the first couple of minutes, building a driving, tech groove before revealing its true identity after a dramatic break where detuned percussion and delayed vocal FX bring the track to a standstill. Cowbellmania ensues going headlong into an afro infused groove before the layers of filtering synths build up to the next peak. All in all, a cleverly crafted track that brings familiar elements together to form a driving, floor-filling groove, that's been getting great responses from early plays."

_SWDW-gkm_c,OPOLOPO - Get On Up (Freestyle jam),192,135602,Z Records,TheZRecords,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6FEH18fWExceOGREFZszQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SWDW-gkm_c,"OPOLOPO ‘Superconductor’ album available now from: http://www.zrecords.ltd.uk/new-releases

iTunes - http://geni.us/OpolopoSuperconductor
Traxsource: http://traxsource.com/title/466514/su...

Opolopo first came to the attention for many as the man behind the genre-crossing house remix of Gregory Porter’s ‘1960 What?’, a tune that finished in the Top Ten of many DJs in 2012. Labeled future jazz by some, it’s only a minor part of the Opolopo story which spans genres like a musical suspension bridge.

Opolopo was born Peter Major in Zirc, Hungary, a short drive away from the beautiful tourist spot Lake Balaton, but spent a large part of his childhood touring around with his keyboardist father, listening to the fusion sounds of Herbie Hancock, Jeff Lorber, Jean-Michel Jarre and Tomita, while finally ending up in his current residence of Sweden. It’s little wonder he’s ended up where he is.

His work, both on remixes and original productions is imbued with a life spent listening to the soul, funk, jazz and fusion of his youth. Yet, while clearly inspired by the past, Opolopo’s work still has enough clank and clamour to suggest its feet are still firmly in the present, whether it’s channeling the sound of a 21st century D-Train, dark, fathoms-deep house or doom-laden dubstep. His reworking of St Germain’s ‘Sure Thing’ suggests someone inheriting Ludovic Navarre own jazz-house crown, while ‘Treat You’ by Omar is underpinned by all sorts of wonkiness while Omar takes care of the topline. His remix and production work has appeared on JVC Japan, Tru Thoughts, Warner Bros, Tokyo Dawn and, of course, Z Records.

Arguably the best way to consume Opolopo is live, where he brings together DJing with an array of gadgetry that suggests an electrified Bob Dylan, switching between playing records, tweaking the vocoder, while still finding time for tasty keyboard flurries in between mixes. You don’t get that with Tiësto.

While Opolopo remixes dart from René & Angela basslines to delicious house music, his album Superconductor, is channeling the ’80s, a decade that has been a constant source of enrichment for the Opolopo sound. Superconductor is firmly built around the song, with many collaborations, among them Keni Burke, Diane Charlemagne, Taka Boom and others. Filleted in between even the tracks seem to a have a stronger purpose than mere fillers. ‘The Run’ sounds like a theme from a long-lost sci-fi programme, while ‘Monolith’ sounds like a tune exhumed from the vaults at Tabu Records. In short, Opolopo is a one man Jam & Lewis.

Opolopo, as you undoubtedly know, is Yoruban for ‘plenty’ and on Superconductor there is a superabundance of sounds, styles and, yes, tunes. Come feast.

""Delerium"" is a candian electronic music group. Regarding ""Silence"" they teamed up with canadian singer ""Sarah McLaughlin"". Over the years the track is being hailed as one of the greatest trance tracks ever. There are several remixes around. The one by ""Fade"" aka Neil Kolo & Chris Fortier was and still is our choice. nearly 12 minutes of epic music production. It was also the version which gave the track the initial ignition to reach stardom. 

We met Chris Fortier from Fade in Mima and he also played at a few of our parties."

Setting out to make some “happy music”, Sophie Lloyd produced ‘Calling Out’ in a dreary January as an antidote to the pervading doom and gloom of the news, summoning the power of the most joy-filled sound of all, gospel. This no-holds-barred anthem radiates all the live atmosphere of gospel worship in mid flow, with full instrumentation, keyboard breaks and understated kick drum pulling it all together. Bringing in the uplifting voices of soul trio Dames Brown to re-record some old gospel samples was the icing on the cake, adding the last element of authenticity. A new member of the Classic family, Sophie Lloyd’s impeccable knowledge of disco, soul and house shines through in this sparkling record, available on 7” for the very first time."

[Intro]
How many shrimps do you have to eat
Before you make your skin turn pink?
Eat too much and you'll get sick
Shrimps are pretty rich

[Verse 1]
なんであいつらはピンク？
動物園で思ったピンク
食べ物でそうなんだ
実は私はたらこが大好き
プラス海老カニ食べよう
ピンク色になるの？
だから皆違う色
人間って勘違いしてるよね

[Chorus]
Black, white, green or blue
Show off your natural hue
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh
If you're multicolored, that's cool too
You don't need to change
It's boring being the same
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh
You're pretty either way
[Verse 2]
鶴の嘴下に向かって曲げたらフラミンゴ
意味不明だけど　面白いでしょ
虹色に染まった世界
今日も地球のどこかで
海老をむしゃむしゃ食べて
フラミンゴはピンク色に染まっていくぜ one, two, three

[Chorus]
Black, white, green or blue
Show off your natural hue
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh
If you're multicolored, that's cool too
You don't need to change
It's boring being the same
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh
You're pretty either way
Flamingo

[Bridge]
How many shrimps do you have to eat
Before you make your skin turn pink?
Eat too much and you'll get sick
Shrimps are pretty rich

[Chorus]
Green or blue
Show off your natural hue
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh
If you're multicolored, that's cool too
You don't need to change
It's boring being the same
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh
You're pretty either way
[Outro]

Salin Records warmly welcomes Diamond to the family, a very talented, young producer based in Oxford (UK), who found a place in our heart. When Diamond reached out to us with a raw demo of ""Target Blue"" we couldn’t get the melody out of our heads for days. The track instantly put a smile on our face and with Alex Wilson's sax lines it spreads an enormous energy which made us feel as if we were 20 again. Later Diamond came up with ""Pen Burns The Paper"" and ""You Like Jazz?"" which built an awesome fundament for an artist EP. There couldn't be a better title than ""You Like Jazz? EP"" as it reflects the personality of the producer - Diamond, who has a kind of obsession with Jazz but at the same time is not too serious about it. We also welcome our dear friend Tour-Maubourg to the label. His breakient mix of ""Target Blue"" is a brilliant example of where inspiration can lead you if you just let it go. His talent for creating emotions is outstanding. Daria Salin adapted the power of Diamonds music in her painting. We are happy and proud to serve you Salin008 ""Diamond - You Like Jazz? EP"", an EP that deserves a special place in your record shelf.

Lyrics

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills 
and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, 
engines on
Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you

Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

This is Ground Control 
to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
if you dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating 
in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much 
she knows

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

Here am I floating 
round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do."

""Feeling Good"" Lyrics:

Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me

For me

Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
It's a new life
For me

And I'm feeling good

I'm feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so good

Randomer is back at once again for L.I.E.S. and again delivers the goods. Taking the entire a-side is Smoking, and it does exactly that as it's a full on club fueled rugged electro cut that does the job straight up and down. Velvet opens the b-side on a different note building huge tension with its buried rave chords waiting just for the right moment for the drums to drop, a proper club beast if used at the right time. Rye closes it out taking it in the other direction with tribal drums and voices in tow driving it home. Massive!

1qNVMaYWuwY,Player ~ Baby Come Back 1977 Soul Purrfection Version,417,19564064,DJDiscoCat,DJDiscoCatV2,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7NzN_pjO1o1eoR_dhaUSg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qNVMaYWuwY,"""Baby Come Back""...I so remember the first time I heard this on WXYZ in Detroit with Dick Purtan in the mornings getting ready to graduate my senior year in high school. It was a nice way to start the day with something gentle and warm to go along with the coffee to go and the snow on the road. Peter Beckett and John Charles Crowley met at a party and agreed to jam together when they found shared musical interets. During the jam session, the duo agreed it was time to put together a band, taking on drummer John Friesen, keyboardist Wayne Cook and bassist Ronn Moss. The production was handled by veteran writer/producers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter agreed to produce Player. The production duo were responsible for the sound of the #1 pop hit Glen Campbell's ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" and Tavares ""It Only Takes A Minute"", two disparate songs that display the range they were capable of. ""The best love songs were written with a broken heart"" sings Karen Carpenter and this gloriously arranged song is proof of that. Beckett and Crowley also bonded because both men had just broken up with their women and used this experience to write ""Baby Come Back"", which came together on a hot summer night rehearsal in Crowley's Los Angeles garage. The band was accused of appropriating the sounds of Hall & Oates, who were incidentally in a slump at the time. Beckett countered that they obviously had not listened to the entire album. The official follow up was ""This Time I'm In For Love"" a #10 Hot100 hit. At the time, the run of #1 was like this, 11 weeks of Debby Boone ""You Light Up My Life"" gave way to Bee Gees ""How Deep Is Your Love"" starting December 24, 1977 for three weeks. Now, the Bee Gees were on RSO Records and so was every #1 Hot100 hit that followed, ""Stayin' Alive"" for four weeks, Player for three weeks, Andy Gibb ""(Love Is) Thicker Than Water"" for two weeks, Bee Gees ""Night Fever"" eight weeks and finally Yvonne Elliman's ""If I Can't Have You"" for one more week, setting a record breaking run at #1 for an amazing 21 weeks, setting several probably will never be broken records like six consecutive #1 singles, the fourth consecutive hit written by Barry Gibb (who broke Lennon-McCartney's 3 consecutive #1's), and the fourth #1 single from the same soundtrack. Man, we were riding quite the wave back then, RSO was not finished either, they added another ten weeks at #1 with Andy Gibb ""Shadow Dancing"" for seven weeks, John Travolta & ONJ ""You're The One That I Want"" for a week and finally Frankie Valli ""Grease"" for two weeks. Whew! that was one hell of a hot summer that carried all the way through to the end of 1979. Player continued recording and releasing albums on a variety of labels, Casablanca, RCA and then River North Records in 1995. They released their last LP ""Too Many Reasons"" in 2013."

Lyrics:
The house of pain is in effect ya'll
The house of pain is in effect
You know the house of pain is in effect
And anyone that steps up is gettin' wrecked
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (c'mon!) c'mon throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump across the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's hoe
Feelin, funkin, amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)
I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel, to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to Kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like, as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
it up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (33X)
Yo, this is dedicated.. to Joe..DeBerg..Dakota!
Grab your bozack, punk!

iQTcBBb8j9E,Dj Koze - XTC (PAMPA024),499,114247,Pampa Records Official,UCOFJQmSjRsHqudPMldT4GTw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFJQmSjRsHqudPMldT4GTw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQTcBBb8j9E,"Release date: june 15, 2015 - get it here: https://pamparecords.com/products/pampa024-xtc-e-p

DJ Koze's 2013 album opus Amygdala has continued to bewitch all who encounter it since its release. Tipped as his own personal Sgt. Pepper, the sublime long-player revealed a fully-realised and personal body of work, complete with a classic songwriting at its core, House in its heart, and veins coursing with psychedelic color. La Duquesa' was the album's dreamy single standout, a journey into deep, tropical ecstasy. XTC' begins in the same spirit, and captures the all the blissful allusions of its name, but its initial gentility belies the deep intensity to come. Floating pads glow with celestial ambience as a kick drum is gradually coaxed into solid form, and the introduction of spoken text begins the second act. Many people are experimenting with the drug Ecstasy,' it says, ...is the drug like the lie and meditation the truth Or am I missing something that could really help me"". XTC' then transforms: sweetly imploring tones become demanding, gentle gradients between chords turn hard-edged, and sharp hi-hats cut through the haze. Complete with Koze's signature percussive quirks, it drives towards the track's final pay off: an undeniable, all-consuming, irresistible high. Knee On Belly' recalls Koze at his most tongue-in-cheek and overt, it is bright, bold and literally brassy, using cut-up horns of all shapes and sizes to patchwork together his own unique arrangement. With the highs and mid ranges accounted for, Koze adds in a swollen, thrumming bass line to mix to bring this floor-filler to life. Knee on Belly' recalls a raw, filtered and funky approach to groove, with a nod to disco house and the art of artful sampling, as it orbits between its own neon highs and simmering lows.

Label - House Of Disco
Released - 16th September 2019
BUY FROM - https://fanlink.to/home-turf

It’s no secret that the Irish know how to party. That energy is epitomised in the bubbling scene of homegrown talent rising through the ranks all over the island. House of Disco, having recently moved back to the Irish shores, let loose their first 4 track sampler EP in 7 years, ‘Home Turf’, showcasing the best in under-represented young Irish producers.

On the flipside, the young gun from Killarney, Shee gets soulful for ‘Me You Us’ with low-slung vocal samples and hazy pads layered over the top of swirling disco loops. Lastly, Wicklow native Purple Ice signs off this killer Irish EP with a blissful, piano infused groover that’s eyes closed ecstasy from start to finish.

Tropical Disco are back with Volume 13, unveiling 4 innovative cuts of disco-house dancefloor shakers on an ever-burgeoning imprint.

Moodena introduces the record in raucous form with ‘Do What You Like’. It’s loose, full of sass, brass and low-slung swing. Staying true to Moodena’s style, it has an effortless aura to it, feeling like a jam while when listened to closely bustles with pinpoint accuracy and detail.

Label - Slightly Transformed
Released - 9th August 2019
BUY FROM - https://www.junodownload.com/products/shit-hot-soundsystem-playaround-ep/4226318-02/

10 months on from his last solo outing – a four-track missive of “Good Vibes” on Midnight Riot – South London’s Shit Hot Soundsystem makes his belated bow on Slightly Transformed. There’s much to enjoy on opener “Playground”, a buzzing, low-slung chunk of mind-altering dub disco full of trippy electronic noises, intense bass, funky guitars and well-placed samples from a New York disco classic. On accompanying cut “Oh My My” he whips off his shirt and runs giddily towards sunny and summery disco pastures, adding his distinctive touch to a glassy eyed early ’80s cut full of chopped-up rifts, celebratory vocal snippets and excitement-building filter sweeps.

Manchester's Yadava steps up to the plate for the next installment of the High Praise Edits series. A member of the cities infamous party collective So Flute collective, Yadava has steadily been making a name for himself as a incredible selector with productions to match (including recent release on the likes of Church and Banoffee Pies records). He also holds down the 'Expansions' show on NTS Radio alongside co-host Contours. 

With his incredible knack for weaving spiritual, soulful and uplifting energies throughout his music, it's no wonder we had to get him on board for High Praise Edits Vol IV.

8TdZIj3ezo4,Gerry Read - It'll all be over (DJ Koze Remix) (PAMPA033),314,329384,Pampa Records Official,UCOFJQmSjRsHqudPMldT4GTw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFJQmSjRsHqudPMldT4GTw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdZIj3ezo4,"Extended version of the track available on PAMPA033 - get it here: https://pamparecords.com/products/pampa033-it-ll-all-be-over

A heaven-made match is now complete with Gerry Read’s debut EP for Pampa Records. The British producer’s distinctively twisted, lo-fi sound, combined with Pampa’s deep-vein instinct for quality quirks, ushers in a new phase for two of house music’s most celebrated names.

The opening bars of “It’ll All Be Over” are immediately evocative, hinting at the patchwork style to come. Twangy banjo strings and a foot-stomp beat seem to herald a folksy arrangement, but that isn’t to be. Soft floaty pads rise up to form an unlikely partnership, softening sharp edges and adding sophisticated melodic expression. Once a compressed vocal sample is introduced, the entire structure reveals itself and begins to spin and loop in the style of iconic French house productions. Propelled further along by the endearing drama of flooded bass drum kicks, falsetto voices and xylophone pings, “It’ll All Be Over” is immediately memorable and expertly architectured.

Read’s second cut, “Satyricon,” is woven in the spirit of micro-house. Sharp waveform cuts, timely pauses, loops of noodling keys and hints of percussion shakers combine for a low-slung psychedelic effect. With the sunniness of a vintage folk-pop sample and sultry snatches of Spanish dialogue added atop a deep mid-tempo shuffle, Read secures his place alongside the Bradocks and Leclairs who came before him.

On the flipside, Pampa’s figurehead takes an expert turn at the controls of “It’ll All Be Over (DJ Koze remix).” The original’s jagged edges are buffed out, and shined up into a gleaming disco house anthem. With its artfully timed strumming breakdowns and cowbell accents, it is an appetising teaser of the forthcoming summer.

https://store.detroitswindle.com/vinyl/heist030
https://store.detroitswindle.com/download/heist030d

The first full artist EP of 2018 is one by a new artist for Heist, but a familiar name for any modern day house aficionado: Adryiano. After taking 2016 off, he came back guns blazing in 2017, releasing 5 solo ep's in 1 year on labels like Shall not Fade and Baka Gaijin. His Me and you and her' ep for Heist showcases his contemporary view on classic house and acid, and is an experiment into how much distortion a track can actually handle when you've got a killer sample hook."

Lush strings and horns compliment a brilliant falsetto lead that pull on the heartstrings. This 45 encompasses everything you want a lowrider slow jam so don't sleep on it. Produced and Recorded entirely at the incomparable Transistor Sound Studio, featuring members of Monophonics, Gene Washington & The Ironsides, Paul & The Tall Trees, His Extraordinaire's Horns and The Sha La Das.

The first of a two part Various Artists release from an international ensemble, cooking up four cuts of prime, underground grooves. 

Denmark’s Roneus kicks things off with ‘What Is Fear, What Is Love?’ A deep, rolling morsel
that flits between darkness and light, menace and melody, echoed by the haunting vocal, calling
out the contrasting emotions of fear and love that perfectly compliment the rhythm. Already
being championed by tastemakers like Ross From Friends, it is the perfect treat to start the
meal.

Lyrics:
Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho
You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawning
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm licking down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way
This ain't got s*** to do with shampoo, but watch your head n shoulder
Brother older bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save your flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom, ain't trying to be handsome
Shrinking what you're thinking cause I'm vamping
I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop so
Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho
You heard a lot about a brother gaining mo' ground
Being low down I do the showdown with any little ho round, no!
I wanna know who you're believing, through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleeping you think I'm cheatin'
You said, ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not cause I hate ya!
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti Written on Ya Kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today
Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hooray!
There's many hungry Hip Hoppers one reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what ya heard cause I ain't bailing no hay
Ain't chopping no crops, but still growing every day
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns beat downs are found
Don't know me don't come around
Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Looking for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots, step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hitting woodies in a hoody
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest, Nice & Smooth & Cypress Hill
I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop so
Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho, smooth it out now

Buy - We Out Here - http://bit.ly/2NRXywv


A primer on London’s bright-burning young jazz scene, this new compilation brings together a collection of some of its sharpest talents. A set of nine newly-recorded tracks, We Out Here captures a moment where genre markers matter less than raw, focused energy. Surveying the album’s running order, it could easily serve as a name-checking exercise for some of London’s most-tipped and hardworking bands of the past couple of years. Recorded across three long, fruitful days in a North West London studio, the results speak for themselves: they’re a window into the wide-eyed future of London’s musical underground. 

KOKOROKO (meaning 'be strong' in Urhobo), are a collective of young musicians brought together by a love for Afrobeat led by trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey. They specialise in a soul shaking, horn fuelled sound with West African roots and inner London hues.

'Abusey Junction' is a ballad written by guitarist Oscar Jerome (fast making a name as an artist in his own right). It was written on the roof of a compound in Gambia where the band spent time last year immersing themselves in the soundscapes of the region.

EP Title: From London With Love
Release Date: Late January

Better Listen is back to cradle snatching for their first release of 2018, debuting young Londoner Joe Corti’s first vinyl release. It’s a four-tracker loaded with dusty samples warped cleverly for max dancefloor action; the A holding percussive party jams and the B offering the lush deep disco sounds the label has become known for.

After a little hiatus OUER are back with the third installment on their own imprint, discovering the spheres and myths around the letter C. This time they explore the deeper melodic shapes of house and techno music while they are not being afraid of getting their hands dirty. The results are three melody driven, deep rolling cuts, longing for the bigger feeling.

Taken from ‘Glue EP’ released 2nd November 2017 via Ninja Tune.

Inspired by the song’s homage to the rave era, the video for Bicep’s GLUE by Joe Wilson is a series of landscapes which revisit the sites once brought alive by now infamous raves. Today they sit desolate and empty, retreating back to their former state, with little to show of their impact they had on UK music culture. The static shots offer space to reflect on the importance and idiosyncrasy of these locations and how an abandoned lido, remote airfield and disused warehouse helped to shape the lives of a generation.

Juxtaposed with the images are the hazy, fragmented recollections of those who were there, lifted from Youtube comment sections of the genre’s most defining sounds. Perhaps the most beautiful and poignant pieces of evidence from the period, they eulogise over a time of unity and euphoria, and are a longing to be returned for just one more night.

↓ LYRICS ↓

Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love

Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love

Why we love

We can bury
Just to know that
Like the sun
Like the sun
Hey, we're in love

Baby you know
If we can do it
We regret it
Honestly waste
Spent too much time within

Why we love
Why we love
Why we love
Why we love

Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love

Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love it
Why we love

UK label Axe on Wax are back with yet another sublabel, with Saint-Petersburg producer Meowsn’ set to inaugurate it. AOWW001 Too Damn Straight EP compiles 4 fun numbers stacked with nostalgic samples, catchy vocal hooks, jazzy improvisations and bouncy basslines.

Our track is Untitled sitting on A2. An endearing sentimental charm is set from the opening, with a warm glitchy fuzziness wobbling between short, filtered vocal jabs. As the bass kicks start to steady us, we become strapped into a distinctive, feel-good groove held together by a bright chordal melody on jazz keys. Meowsn periodically interrupts the momentum by playfully chucking in some cheeky pauses or energetic vocal samples, and it feels like we’re switching channels on an old colour TV.

The first AOWW is set for an October release. Pre-order the vinyl here!"

Releasedate: 14.07.2017
Label: Senso Sounds
Cat. Nr.: senso027
From the upcoming Album „Propaganda“ (Release 13.10.2017)
Buylink: https://SensoSounds.lnk.to/Rotlicht

Oliver Huntemann remains one of the most recognized names in techno, having pursued his singular vision for quality electronic music for over 20 years. The producer and DJ calls Hamburg home, and exhibits all of the city’s best traits -valuing directness and quality over style or artifice. One of the undoubted highlights of Huntemann’s upcoming 'Propaganda' long player is 'Rotlicht - an epic exploration of tension and release, primed for maximum dancefloor impact. Here it’s presented in its full glory and joined by a tough-as-nails remix by Raxon. The Egyptian DJ and producer, born and raised in the United Arab Emirates, locks deep into the groove and adds his own delicious spin to what might just be one of the big tracks of the year."

In February 2016 Midland made his contribution to the hugely influential BBC Essential Mix series. The end of the mix came in the shape of an unreleased track that would go on to soundtrack dance floors and festivals the world over. That track was 'Final Credits.' Since its creation in the depths of winter to its vinyl release in June, with weekly airings everywhere from Panorama Bar to DC10 to Dekmantel Festival, the record has united dance floors and become one of the most unlikely tracks of the year. As the summer disappeared, calls for a full release of 'Final Credits' have swelled, and now, thanks to The Classic Music Company we're delighted to say this is becoming a reality.

N’to is finally back with a brand new release on Hungry Music and his mission is to wave an exciting summer season goodbye in perfect style. His latest two-track endeavor features handcrafted sounds and lush grooves. 

La Clé Des Champs is an arpeggiated excursion into N’to’s world of deep frequencies and mesmerizing pads. Crisp hi-hat patterns gently provide the energy, while thick moog-ish melodies set the vibe.

The laid back, charismatic In The Mood For Noune composition is the perfect soundtrack for a late summer evening. Built around a slow jamming groove and funky shakers, the earthy tones dance wonderfully alongside the sparkling & heartfelt keys."

Lyrics:

Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coat carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

The flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away

Founded in 2014 by Joss moog, Around7 (also producers for Robsoul Recordings) & House lover Jean Cé (aka SFD), the new Parisian label, Ondulé Recordings,  wants to offer a quality sound attached to the roots of house music. 
Deeply inspired by disco, funk, soul/jazz & hip hop, Ondulé will offer a wide range of electronic music to listen to from the couch to the dancefloor, having always one word in mind: GROOVE!!   
We could say deep house, jacking house, nu disco, down tempo… but it doesn't matter after all, Ondulé Recordings has to be a shelter for freedom in music. 
As the name of the label indicates (""Ondulé"" stands for ""Wavy"" in English), what we think today might not be what we'll think tomorrow: Ondulé's music  needs to make you undulate.

Lyrics:
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

[Chorus]
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day

Lyrics:
'Q-Tip: Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin
It was I, The Abstract
'Phife Dawg: And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
You on point Phife?
All the time, Tip
You on point Phife? 
All the time, Tip
You on point Phife? 
All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Back in days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fitting
It was I the Phifer 
And me The Abstract
The rhymes were so rumping that the brothers rode the 'zack
Yo Tip you recall when we used to rock
Those fly routines on your cousin's block
Um, let me see, damn I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip?
All the time Phife
You on point Tip? 
Yeah, all the time Phife
You on point Tip? 
Yo, all the time Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and
Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop
NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out. Out
In London"

With his modern, inspired by Detroit & New Jersey style house vibes, this talented young french DJ/Producer is fast becoming a hot name on the house scene...

""This EP is heavily inspired by my time spent in Seoul, South Korea, and especially these amazing minutes, when at night, you cross the Han River -- by the Hannam Bridge -- feeling how wide & impressive the river & the whole city are... and suddenly you would like to stop the time and to have this Nightride to last endlessly..."" Fulbert

Fulbert isn't falling into a category of producers that are writing music because it's on trend, he's all about a deep rooted, heartfelt love of house. https://foulandsunk.bandcamp.com/"

generation, digital native, who recognise no taboos and think that good taste is a boring option. They bring a
breath of fresh air to the whole electronic scene. I hear my first Bloody Beetroots track on the Fluokids blog. I feel
like my eardrums are touching inside my head ! I think they’re a bit surprised when I ask them for a remix – and
I’m even more surprised to see how popular this remix is with the younger generation.

Gopher helped me a lot with this disc, and so he and Julien Delfaud come along to perform the album live with
me. We scour the clubs of Europe and share some extraordinary moments together. But above all we see the
return of electronic music to where it really belongs – in clubs and then on festival stages.

Lyrics:
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Oooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Lyrics:


I must've died and gone to heaven
Cos it was a quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across from where I'm standing
On the dance floor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time
Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetise
Do I have to go star-trekking
Cos it's you I should be checking
So she lazer beamed me with her cosmic eyes

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic"

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
""There must be some kind of way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word""
Hey!

[Verse 2]
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late
Hey!

[Guitar Solo]

Hey!

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well, uh, outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey!

[Outro]
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

Album : Dusty Sundays
Label : Amadeus

Moody and dimly lit are the words that spring to mind when listening to ""In Between"" from Chaos in the CBD, a pair of New Zealand brothers delving into deep house for the Amadeus imprint. Taken from the Dusty Sundays EP, the duo sets the stage with vintage snares and drawn-out cooing, allowing a haunting atmosphere take hold until harps, playground sounds, and free-floating chords dance into view. The warbling, mid-heavy bassline makes its presence felt halfway through the track, smoothing the entry for an arpeggiated synth solo that never quite takes off, allowing the track to ebb and flow in an interesting show of restraint. The four-track effort is out now and includes a Jack Dixon remix; check the full EP stream after the jump, and if you haven't yet, check out our most recent podcast from Mr. Dixon, here. - XLR8R

Qc89T_KPNWc,Outkast - M.s Jackson,271,34513533,5o5jamZ,5o5jamZ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdr4QjnmGU3zAXhMJ3zqbRw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc89T_KPNWc,"Hot Track from Outkast´s Album Stankonia.

Stankonia

Originally titled 'Sandbox', the pair's fourth album, Stankonia was released in October 2000 to excellent reviews. The album was seen as a change in the group's musical style, as it had a more commercial and mainstream appeal, compared to their previous three albums which were darker and deeper. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified quadruple-platinum. Stankonia's first single was ""B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)"", a high-tempo jungle-influenced record. The second single, ""Ms. Jackson"", combined a pop hook with lyrics about divorce and relationship breakups, particularly André's breakup with singer Erykah Badu; the titular ""Ms. Jackson"" character being a doppelgänger for Badu's mother. It was at this time that André changed his stage name to the current ""André 3000"".
 
The single became their first pop hit, landing the number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the number-two position on the UK Singles Chart. The album's final single was the Organized Noize-produced ""So Fresh, So Clean"", featuring a credited guest appearance from regular guest vocalist and Organized Noize-member Sleepy Brown and garnered a remix featuring Snoop Dogg. All three singles' videos had heavy MTV2 airplay, and OutKast won two 2001 Grammy Awards, one for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for ""Ms. Jackson"", and another for Stankonia as Best Rap Album.
 
During the recording of Stankonia OutKast and Mr. DJ began producing tracks for the artists on their Aquemini Records imprint through Columbia, including Slimm Cutta Calhoun and Killer Mike, who made his debut on Stankonia's ""Snappin' & Trappin.""
 
Pitchforkmedia.com named Stankonia the 4th greatest album released between 2000 and 2004 in its 2005 feature. Later on the webzine selected Stankonia as the 13th best album of the 2000s. And B.O.B. was chosen number one song of the decade by this same webzine.

All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey (and the sky is grey)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (on a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (if I was in L.A.)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher like the cold (preacher like the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey (and the sky is grey)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (on a winter's day)
If I didn't tell her (if I didn't tell her)
I could leave today (I could leave today)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day

An abbreviated single version was released reaching number one on the Pop Standard chart and was named Record of the Year in 1965. The album won the 1965 Grammy Awards for Best Album of the Year, Best Jazz Instrumental Album - Individual or Group and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. The personel are Stan Getz - tenor saxophone, João Gilberto - guitar, vocals, Astrud Gilberto -- vocals, Antonio Carlos Jobim - piano, Sebastião Neto -- bass, and Milton Banana - drums. The version presented here is the long one from the album and is, in my opinion, superior to the shortened one which received a great deal of play on the radio during the summer of 1964. The album is available on CD on Verve. This sound recording is administered by UMG.  No copyright infringement is intended.

How can a loser ever win?

Duck Sauce is the musical collaboration between deejay heroes A-Trak and Armand Van Helden, melding the spirit of classic disco house with updated production thump and clever new twists – think modern-day versions of DJ classics from labels like Roule, or Armand’s own beloved mid-90s catalog.

Deee-Lite was formed in 1986 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn by vocalist Lady Miss Kier and multi-instrumentalist Super DJ Dmitry and became popular in the New York club scene as a vibrant and lively dance act known for their unique Holographic Techno Soul, psychedelic light show, and innovative art direction. Jungle DJ Towa Towa officially joined the group in 1989 contributing production on the first album and both songwriting and production on the second. Deee-Lite broke up in 1993 but all three artists continue to deejay to this day."

Lyrics:

We get it almost every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose they keep it tight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight"

Lyrics:
I, I'm I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you
Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me, be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Oh baby
Let's, let's stay together (gether)
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Why, why some people break up
Then turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
Staying around you is all I see
(Here's what I want us do)
Let's, we oughta stay together (gether)
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on
Let's stay, (let's stay together) let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether times are good or bad

The Winstons - Amen, Brother ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winstons )

Wikipedia Source:
""The Winstons were a 1960s funk and soul music group, based in Washington, D.C.. They are known for their 1969 recording of an EP featuring a song entitled ""Color Him Father"" on the A-side, and a song entitled ""Amen, Brother"" on the B-side. Half-way into ""Amen, Brother"", there is a drum solo (performed by G.C. Coleman) which would cause The Winston's EP to become one of the most widely-sampled records in the history of electronic music. Sampled audio clips of the drum solo became known as the Amen Break, which has been used in thousands of tracks in a large number of musical genres, including drum and bass, hip hop, jungle, big beat, industrial and electronica.

The ""Color Him Father"" record sold over one million copies, and received a gold record awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 24 July 1969.""


Label : (Metromedia Records, BMI) 


Biography by Ron Wynn & Bruce Eder :
A Washington, D.C.-based soul act led by Richard Spencer, the Winstons signed to Curtom in early 1968 and lasted there for one single, the rousing ""Need a Replacement."" They had a sound that was somewhat similar to the Impressions, but were unfortunate enough to have signed with Curtom before the label had national distribution, and the single never got the play it should have. A year after leaving Curtom, they hit for the Metromedia label with a huge single called ""Color Him Father,"" which became a Top Ten R&B and pop hit, just missing number one on the R&B list, and also earned a Grammy for Best R&B Song. It was both a great tribute number and outstanding lead vocal from Richard Spencer, along with Ray Maritano, Quincy Mattison, Phil Tolotta, Sonny Peckrol, and G.C. Coleman. Mattison and Coleman were veterans of Otis Redding's band. The Winstons eventually toured as the backup band for the Impressions, but never again made any noise on the charts. 

 The Winstons line-up included:

Gregory C. Coleman (vocals, drums)
Ray Maritano (vocals, alto saxophone)
Quincy Mattison (vocals, lead guitar)
Sonny Pekerol (vocals, bass guitar)
Richard Lewis Spencer (lead vocals, tenor saxophone)
Phil Tolotta (second lead, organ)

Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Almost all the things that your eyes once promised
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Almost blue
It's almost touching it will almost do
There's a part of me that's always true...always
Not all good things come to an end now it is only a chosen few
I've seen such an unhappy couple
ALMOST Me/You/Blue"

Anime: Cowboy Bebop
OST: Cowboy Bebop OST 1 (1998)
[audio]

Cowboy Bebop (カウボーイビバップ, Kaubōi Bibappu) is a Japanese animated television series. Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and written by Keiko Nobumoto, Cowboy Bebop was produced by Sunrise. Consisting of 26 episodes, the series follows the adventures of a group of bounty hunters traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop, in the year 2071.

Cowboy Bebop was a commercial success both in Japan and international markets, notably in the United States. After this reception, Sony Pictures released a feature film, Knockin' on Heaven's Door to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international DVD release. Two manga adaptations were serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX.

Cowboy Bebop has been strongly influenced by American music, especially the jazz movements of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and the early rock era of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its action sequences, from space battles to hand-to-hand martial arts combat, are set and timed to music. Following the musical theme, episodes are called Sessions, and titles are often borrowed from album or song names (such as Sympathy for the Devil or My Funny Valentine), or make use of a genre name (""Mushroom Samba"") indicating a given episode's musical theme.

EP Title: The Four J's
Release Date: July 2018

After reaching 100k subscribers on YouTube, the channel Houseum cross over to the next step with the launch of their new label Houseum Records. Their first release ‘The Four J’s’ features four bumping house tropes from channel regulars Bellaire, Subjoi, Gavinco and Jesse Bru. This release represents the achievement of the work done on the channel by releasing four tracks with four differing, infectious vibes.

The A side begins with Bellaire’s ‘Oh’ which is a club driven house track with a catchy loop and sensual vocals built for summer dance floors. We continue the journey with ‘Show Yourself’ by the Australian Subjoi which is a rhythmic and soothing track, punctured by a pulsating sample. A groove that is as introspective as it is joyful.

On the B side, the young English Gavinco delivers a house driven number sprinkled with jazzy notes. Trumpet and piano punctuate the rhythm of the track. We end the trip with the mesmerizing ’Setup’ produced by Jesse Bru. One that exudes a certain melancholy. A hypnotic simplicity that warms the heart.

It’s not often we get to cover the reissue of a classic, so when a re-release of KGB’s Italian house classic “Detroit 909” hit our inbox, we immediately jumped at the chance. Originally written and produced by Ivan Iacobucci in 1991, these NU versions of a somewhat underappreciated track were more than welcome. Dropping via Cosmic Rhythm, a southern Italian label with a penchant for mystic sounds, black grooves, atmospheric dreamy vibes and natural elements, this collection of reinterpretations are sure to get the mind wandering, the blood pumping, and the feet shuffling.

The A2, “Detroit 909 (Cosmic Garden mix),” is a stand-out for us. Glittery, ascending arpeggiated synths lead immediately into a beautifully washed out tropical atmosphere full of chirping birds and the calming sounds of a babbling brook. What ensues is the obvious sounds of the beloved 909 drum machine, it’s deep kick and robotic snare drum are infinitely recognizable as they carry the track towards a chilled, but heavily groovy bassline that’s more hypnotic than a 90s magic eye poster. The “Cosmic Garden mix” feels like a trip into your grandma’s garden if your grandma was a space pioneer cultivating her plants and harvesting her crops on some distant planet inhabited only by her and gorgeous, other-wordly creatures.

Keep an eye on Cosmic Rhythm, they’re off to a great start and have already released a few excellent projects. If the reimaginings of “Detroit 909” are an indicator of an even brighter future, then we best get our sunglasses out."

""Special thanks to all the rhythms my entourage's heart has beaten to, to the light that showed me the way through the mist of existence, to every word written on paper that taught me who I am, to all of my friends for their inspiration on this quest for happiness, to love in all its forms, and to unexpected appearances.
I'm used to looking for colors in different shades of grey during the last days of summer but, in its beauty, I found you my friends. My last thanks goes to music.""

Love to my chosen family."

Our first release, Forgot 001, is a four-track compilation set for release on 18 August 2017.

The EP spans many genres and draws influence from house, disco, hip-hop, jazz, funk and soul. The array of sounds and variety of production styles blend effectively and, whilst each track is unique in its own right, the compilation as a whole truly represents a sound we hope to promote.
Forgot resident Hoffy opens the EP with  Makei Klap ; a mid-tempo, jazz infused cut with an infectious piano loop and shuffling kicks. Brownswood Recordings affiliate Ratomagoson takes the tempo down with  Diesel Pump , a bass heavy, hip-hop oriented track, cleverly flipping a well-known vocal sample to great effect. The B-side introduces a deeper element;  David’s Vocal  from second Forgot resident Joe S fuses fizzy low-end synths, heavy hitting kick drums and loose, wandering melodies. The final track,  It Just Makes , is the heaviest offering from the release. Pila combines an effective, rolling bass line, creative hi-hat patterns and a cleverly chosen vocal sample.
Forgot is a collective made up of Jack Blythman, Jamie Cooling, Joe Cooling, Henry Hoffman, Joe Martin and Tomas Smare.

3xXyEsDCetE,Theo Erikkson - Mr Herrn,245,10088,Houseum,UC58C_BhzlZIJTeomuVSD2lA,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58C_BhzlZIJTeomuVSD2lA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xXyEsDCetE,"Straight out of Stockholm, Night Vision is proud to serve up Theo Erikkson's debut EP, ""Mr Herrn"". Unknown to the world at large (and still to us), Theo is a newbie that has nailed his first EP it in a way many up-and-comers wish they could. All three tracks are dusty, quick to the point groovers that we couldn't help but love. What they lack in length, they more than make up for in feel. Ranging from the approachable to the straight up weird, this is one for the birds and the bees.

It seemed only fitting to ask fellow Swede, Crackazat, to hop on the remix. Armed with the very flowery stems of Mr Herrn, the man came through with a that keeps the sensual feelings of the original and, with a twist, turns it into a dance floor smasher.

Enjoy what has become our crew’s Summer jam and let the mysterious Theo Erikkson be your guide to the season.

RTCT.Records are back at it again! Following up on two well received twelves by Demuja and Leo Woelfel the family is growing by yet another fine fella: Put your hands together for Laroze!

The french house legend came up with a strong mixture of disco, house and acid flavors covering a wide range of moods. Be careful to put these 5 tracks in your bag, because if you do they’ll probably stay there for a while…this record will go from zero to anywhere quicker than you can say “Austrian labels do it best”!

But it's also a gliding step in which one foot is kept in advance of the other...

About the EP:
The Belgian Duo Chassé heats up the Flux Compensator and takes us on a hilarious time travel right back to the mid 1990`s with their new EP „Word up Kids“.Pumping Chicago Grooves meet dope down funk & soul loops - just the right mix to make you freak out on the mid-summer-dancefloor. These 12“es are a defo essential for surgin‘ the incoming 90s revival wave. Pretty much remarkable that ""Word up Kids“ is actually Chassés vinyl debut - whats gonna be next?

Carré Bleu Records is releasing its first EP on vinyl 12 inch !

This EP called « Double Epaisseur » reflects what we always dreamt of : a quality vinyl project with groovy tracks made by a french independent artist in his bedroom.

Hubz is an emerging french talent, engineering student on weekdays and house producer the rest of the time. His eclectic influences and his rare creativity match perfectly our label and what we want to work for.

Make sure you preorder your vinyl here so that we can make our dreams come true !

Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody close your eyes, ascend, go up
Everybody close your eyes, ascend, go up
Everybody

I remember, a little kid
I remember singing a song
Do you remember when you were young?
Don't you remember when you were singing along?

My-My-My-Ma-Maria
My-My-My-My-Guayin
My-My-My-My-Maria
Oh wakachan hasaya
Oh wakachan hasaya

I don't know what you're looking for
But you're more than welcome with us
Traveling at the speed of mind
To enhance our fight within love
Beyond the stratosphere, you just wanna go up, ay
Like a child's balloon filled with helium, ay

I remember our fun
I remember our own on the run
Do you remember where we belong?
Don't you remember when you were singing along?

My-My-My-Ma-Maria
My-My-My-My-Guayin
My-My-My-My-Maria
Oh wakachan hasaya
Oh wakachan hasaya

I don't know what you're looking for
But you're more than welcome with us
Traveling at the speed of mind
To enhance our fight within love
Beyond the stratosphere, you just wanna go up, eh
Like a child's balloon filled with helium, eh
I don't know what you're looking for
But you're more than welcome with us
Traveling at the speed of mind
To enhance our fight within love
Beyond the stratosphere, you just wanna go up, eh
Like a child's balloon filled with helium, eh
Everybody close your eyes, ascend and go up
Everybody close your eyes, ascend and go up

My hearts been picked up way too many times
Wrong numbers fill my blood watch the spinning dials

You can measure my pressure but I’ll blow up in a second

Don't put me on hold please
Fly here and hold me

He doesn't call me so put me through operator
Maybe I’ll leave him and fall in love with you operator
My baby doesn't call me so put me through operator
So tell me should I leave him and fall in love with you operator

The miles keep adding up voicemails of frustration
Long-distance takes it’s toll give me information

It’s like I’ve got a broken heart and I need a kick-start"

Original creator of this mashup is SHOKK 青
Check it out here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cOAUSVBGX8

The only reason i put this together was not to steal views, likes or Subs from SHOKK 青 but because i really wanted to make a longer version of the song.

Original song: Glue70-Casin
Acapella: Shake That-Nate Dogg & Eminem

i couldnt find a full version of the mashup so i made one myself, i will take the video down of the original maker of the song does not like it."

LYRICS : 
They say it's matter of time, 
A thousand days and the sun won't shine
Before I come back to yo

I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home
i'm making my way

For your love I will go far 
I wanna be wherever you are 
I'm know i'm coming back for you

Our love is a river long, 
The best right in a million wrongs
I know i'm coming back to you

And i'm happy nothing's going to be stop me 
I'm making my way home
I'm making my way 
I go solo, oh I go solo
I'm making my way home
I'm making my way

I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way, i'm making my way
I go solo, oh go solo, 
I'm making my way home
I'm making my way"

Konnichiwa Senpai, Please notice me,
I watch Asian cartoons, I'm a weeaboo,
I live in my mom's house. I'm like thirty two,
I collect swords and throwing stars, yes I'm a weeaboo,
Sticks and Stones may break my bones,
But I will always be one step ahead of you,
'Cause I read the manga,
(You're such a fucking pleb, are you even even japanese bro)
I haven't showered in like sixteen weeks,
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me,
'Cause all'O'sudden, I think I'm japanese
Yes I'm a weeaboo x4
A filthy weeaboo (snorts Naruto is SO Over-rated)
A dirty weeaboo (You wanna see my katana collection)
A fucking weeaboo (I'm learning Japanese on Rosetta stone)
A disgusting weeaboo (So I'm like basically Japanese now)
i sit at my computer desk, and argue with teenagers on the internet,
about atheism, and how japan is superior to other countries,
i learned a bit of japanese,
so now i'm qualified to be a part of their community
so i made my avatar a kawaii waifu
yes im a weeaboo x8

Lyrics

I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like
Coca Cola
C-O-L-A Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, ""Lola""
L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, ""Little boy, won't you come home with me?""
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes
Well, I almost fell for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her, and she at me
Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, ""Little boy, gonna make you a man""
Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

PooPoo PeePee, Penis and Vagina,
Women with dicks and weak men with vaginas,
so fucking delicate like mommy's fine china,
If you have complaints please wait your turn and line up!
I got a message for these little fags trynna
be a mommy's boy and a teachers pet, pimple face, asswipe, looking like they just had a gyne-cologist
Stick five fingers in your ass, no lube.
So what'cha gonna do?
If you're number one, shove it up your ass and make it number 2. (Ooo)
Ladies getting mad in the comments, and I'm hearing it
You think it was a typo with these red lines and periods. (OoOoOoo)
Ha Ha no comma, bitches with their self esteem get out of the sauna.
My shit lies in the sewers, closing the hatch,
I only joke about diseases and reference that only you can catch. (Ew, oh my god.)
And if you think you're fucking grown up, keep breathing heavy with your keyboard and fedora.
Hands around your dick with the kung-fu grip, stroking back and forth to My Little Pony clips bitch.
Go outside and ride a bike or something,
And get laughed at by kids to remind you that you are NOTHING!
And then, get hit by every car or truck that ever passes,
Your life flashes before your eyes! Oh wait it's your Google Glasses.
Never mind faggot, just pick your ass up and take you to the closest sign faggot,
I'm not done yet, you get up and you go home,
Sit at your computer and open up Google Chrome,
And then look at tutorials oh how to hang yourself at home.
And then you can hang yourself.
Is-Is that the end of the story?
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha, No son.

Kill yourself, please please kill yourself,
You should really kill yourselves. (x2)

I got a little bit of that anal cream for your asshole."

Like a sound you hear
That lingers in your ear
But you can't forget
From sundown to sunset

It's all in the air
You hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It's gonna grab a hold on you

California soul, California soul
They say the sun comes up every morning
And if you listen carefully
The winds that ride on the high time
Whistle a melody
And so the people started to sing
And that's how the surf gave birth untold
California soul, California soul

When you hear the beat
You wanna pat your feet
And you've got to move
Cause it's really such a groove

Puts a brand new kind of thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong
Cause you're groovin' all day long
California soul, California soul

They had the melody and the beat
But it still didn't seem complete
Until they saw two lovers kissin'
They knew just what was missin'

So happy they were rockin' and reelin'
Because they added that lovin' feeling
To California soul, California soul
California soul"

Blue Boy is a pseudonym for the Scottish DJ, Alexis 'Lex' Blackmore.
The single Remember Me peaked at #8 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1997. The single also went to number two on the American dance chart.
The track is built around two samples from the 1973 live version of ""Woman of the Ghetto"", a 1969 soul song by Marlena Shaw, originally recorded for her album The Spice of Life. Near the end is the line: ""Remember me? I'm the one who had your babies"", in reference to African-American maids raising white children for little pay.

Touch stinks. This opens a door for me. I want to make some music without computers or samples or singles for
radio! I use the beat-boxes and synthesizers that did the job at the very start of techno to produce the sounds that
made me fall in love with it. Since I don’t have to make singles, I ask Camille to come and sing on Fast Track –
and make it into a single!

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Is this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
And I got a lump in my throat 'cause

""Lets suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream, and you would naturally as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure, you see, and after several nights you would say, well that was pretty great, but now lets have a surprise, lets have a dream which isn't under control. Well something is going to happen to me that i don't know what it's gonna be. Then you would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream, and finally you would dream where you are now."" - Alan Watts

↓ LYRICS ↓

I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray
The day you walked away
You were the clock
That was ticking in my heart
Changed my state of mind
But love's so hard to find

Your feelings change like the weather
Went from clear to grey
On that cloudy day
How can I go on
With that bomb in the palm
Love's so hard to find
When someone's on your mind

Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
What can I do to make
My baby understand

Something tells me that I'm dreamin'
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds
You need someone you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
What can I do to make my baby understand
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there

Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
What can I do to make my baby understand
Follow me into, into my sleep
Baby I'm yours, I'm yours to keep
You've got the magic that entered my heart and my mind

Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand

Lyrics:

Take a risk
Well that's all you keep on saying
And the point that I'm relaying is it shouldn't be like this
And you know
While I'm sitting here this evening
I just know I should be leaving but it's too late for me to go
And now a kiss
Well you planted that one on me
And granted it has thrown me and it's futile to resist
But don't you see
If people see us here together, we've thrown it all away

I, oh I,
I just can't be seen with you
Oh I
I just can't be seen with you

Lets go
And get away to somewhere quiet
Where we can be in private away from prying eyes
And loose lips
That'll get us into trouble see the whole world tumble down
Well you say you're feeling crazy
And I'm feeling crazy too
But I couldn't carry on like this without it hurting you
'Cause you know that I am married
And I know that you are too so
I just can't be seen
With you

Oh I
I just can't be see with you
Oh I,
I just can't be seen with you
Oh I, Oh I
I just can't be seen with you
Oh I,
I just can't be seen with you

I just can't be seen with
I just can't be seen with
I just can't be seen with you

Oh I, Oh I
I just can't be seen with you
Oh I,
I just can't be seen with you
Oh I, Oh I
I just can't be seen with you

Combine the best band in France right now, acclaimed director Daniel Wolfe, production by Somesuch & Co, and one of the hottest young actors on the planet and you're sure to get a banging filmclip.

We scored the world premiere of The Shoes newest video which features Jake Gyllenhaal as a disturbed killing machine who chases his victims up fire escapes, into back alleys, and through strip clubs before he violently slays them.

It's awesome!!!

Lyrics: 
The future´s something we can barely see
there´s something missing in the way we feel
and I have noticed
in myself that I can´t let it go
wanna make a difference
and believe in what we´re gonna show

gotta understand how things could be this way
you make a difference in a different way
and I've been feelin
how you show our love so easily
now i know how we could be
forever caught in time

when it comes to loving we´re gonna seize the day
never knew that we could ever be this way
cause I've been searching
deep within and out of every door
now i know this feelin
i wont ever let you down

you give me something I can feel it in my soul
when it comes to loving you I lose my self-control
always thought that this was it and you´re gonna be the last
now we see the future coming, we can't forget the past

Looking back and all we've had to get on through
when it really mattered it was there for me and you
now our world is changing we got to see what we´re gonna do
i know you're here for me and I will always ...

Want you in my soul
I want you in my soul, said i want you in my soul
your love to me is gold
your love to me is gold, your love to me is gold
This thing i can't control
this thing i can't control, this thing I can't control
just let this feeling go
gonna let the feeling go, gonna let the feeling go

Our past has been but we cant let it go
just looking back on all the things we've done
and I have noticed
in myself i could have changed it all
gonna make a difference
and believe in what we´re gonna show

gotta stand alone and try to lead the way
i made my feelings known in every day
and I've been seeing
how you make your peace within so easily
now I know that love will be
forever caught in time

when it comes to changing I'm gonna be that one
don't have regrets for all the things I've done
and i´m believing
deep within the core of every soul
now i know the reason
you wont ever let me down

You give me something i can feel it in my soul
when it comes to loving u i lose my self-control
always thought that this was it and you're gonna be the last
now we see the future common and we cant forget the past

looking back and all we've had to get on through
when it really mattered it was there for me and you
now our world is changing we got to see what we´re gonna do
i know you're here for me and i will always ..."

Footage taken from the Roller Boogie movie. 

Lyrics:
You know I used to be alright,
When you woke me in the morning, waiting for the sun to shine,
And do the two-step all night,
Then you'd spin me round and catch me, laughing as the sun would rise.

Oh I don't know what to do,
You speak a foreign language, what you've put me through,
The enemies, I know you're hiding one or two,
But I just can't say no to you

So I can't let you go 
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go
When you won't say.
I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go while
I slip away

Boy it's just a puzzle and the pieces they are scattered on the floor,
It's a silly little game and the sentences are scribbled on the wall,
You think you have the time to wash off all the ugly lies,
But the bottom of the matter is it takes up all your time.
Takes up all your time.

Oh I don't know what to do,
You speak a foreign language, what you've put me through,
The enemies, I know you're hiding one or two,
But I just can't say no to you.

So I can't let you go 
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go
When you won't say.
I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go while
I slip away.

Never ending stories lead me to the door,
Then I wait alone just like I did before,
Another mystery is laying down the rhyme,
It seems you are distracted and you'll never have the time.

So I can't let you go 
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go
When you won't say
I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go while
I slip away"

The Kinks-Sunny Afternoon#LYRICS#
Songwriters: Davies, Raymond Douglas


The tax man's taken all my dough, 
And left me in my stately home, 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon. 
And I can't sail my yacht, 
He's taken everything I've got, 
All I've got's this sunny afternoon. 

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze. 
I got a big fat mama trying to break me. 
And I love to live so pleasantly, 
Live this life of luxury, 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon. 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 

My girlfriend's run off with my car, 
And gone back to her ma and pa, 
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty. 
Now I'm sitting here, 
Sipping at my ice cool beer, 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon. 

Help me, help me, help me sail away, 
Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay. 
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly, 
Live this life of luxury, 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon. 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 
In the summertime 

Ah, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze. 
I got a big fat mama trying to break me. 
And I love to live so pleasantly, 
Live this life of luxury, 
Lazing on a sunny afternoon. 
In the summertime 
In the summertime

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop, hey, what's that sound

Lyrics:
Is Dexter ill, Is Dexter ill, Is Dexter ill
Is Dexter ill today, Mr Kirk, Dexter's in school
I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishborne
Dexter's truancy problem is way out of hand
The Baltimore County school board have decided to expel
Dexter from the entire public school system
Oh Mr Kirk, I'm as upset as you to learn of Dexter's truancy
But surely, expulsion is not the answer!
I'm afraid expulsion is the only answer
It's the opinion of the entire staff that Dexter is criminally insane
That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic,
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch! What does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Play the kazoo, let's have it tune
On the count of three
That, that, that, that, that boy.. boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet
And he also made false teeth
Avalanches is above, business continues below
Did I ever tell you the story about
Cowboys! Bit , bit bitches and the indians and, Fron, Frontier Psychiatrist
I, I felt strangely hypnotised
I was in another world, a world of 20.000 girls
And milk! Rectangles, to an optometrist, the man with the golden eyeball
And tighten your buttocks, pour juice on your chin
I promise my girlfriend I'd, the violin, violin, violin
Frontier Psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch, what does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Ranagazoo, let's have a tune
Now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that boy.. boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet
And he also made false teeth
Frontier Psychiatrist
Can you think of anything else that talks, other than a person?
Uh ohh, uh oh, a bird! Yeah!
Sometimes a parrot talks
Ha ha ha ha ha !!!!
Yes, some birds are funny when they talk
Can you think of anything else
A record, record, record !
